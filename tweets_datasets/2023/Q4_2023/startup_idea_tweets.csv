https://twitter.com/StartupArchive_/status/1737093268884558247#m,"OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor explains why platform shifts are a fruitful source of startup ideas  Bret Taylor is now the chairman of OpenAI. Before that, he co-created Google Maps, co-founded FriendFeed (sold to Facebook for $50M), was the CTO of Facebook, co-founded Quip (sold to Salesforce for $750M), and was the co-CEO of Salesforce.  In the clip below he explains that when deciding what to work on next, he will often ask himself “when this platform exists, what habits will change?”  He believes that platform shifts are large drivers of economic value. For example, the PC led to the creation of Microsoft and Apple, and the Internet gave rise to companies like Amazon and Google.  “The reason I believe platform shifts are meaningful is that it changes the balance of power between incumbents and startups. It was very hard to compete with Microsoft on PCs because they practically owned the entire stack. But in the age of the smartphone, it was a completely different story because they don’t control the operating system, they don’t control the hardware, and all of a sudden you’re on slightly more equal footing with these very powerful incumbents. And your agility as a startup and your native understanding of the platform can outweigh their strength in finances and employees.”  At this @StartupGrind event in 2018, he posits that mobile will be the biggest platform shift for a while and that AI has the capability of doing that but “it’s just sort of early days.”  ""When you're thinking of startup ideas, going to the rising tide that will lift your boat is definitely a good starting point. It's a very broad direction, but I do think people often choose a niche and don't think through why their startup will succeed versus incumbents. It's really important to think about that strategically.""","Dec 19, 2023 · 12:51 PM UTC",221,6

It's like HTML/CSS but for mobile apps.  And we combine it with an efficient work process.  Our work process:  1. Onboarding call  We discuss your ideas and learn about your product. The head of design gives audits about potential problems and assigns the tasks to designers.  2. Wireframing  In a single day, we plan out how your app will behave.  3. Coding  Only 7 days to build an app with technical requirements.  4. UI iterations  At this stage, we are ready to make your app look perfect.  5. Deployment  The app is ready to onboard the first clients and gather information about necessary fixes.  ---  Of course, polishing the app takes more than 7-9 days.  But...  With our method, you can:  – Save months or even years of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars for the V1 MVP release – Get access to top-tier coders and designers without hiring and onboarding. – Get ready to raise money because you have a working solution  ---  We have one spot left this month to make your idea into a product.  ---  – Drew from Infinite Shelf Design","Dec 19, 2023 · 1:22 PM UTC",49,5

""Ability of founder to navigate through the Idea Maze""  Marc Andreessen shared a perspective on what he looks for in a startup founder -   ""When meeting a founder, what we're looking for is their ability to navigate the ""idea maze."" This term, coined by our partner, describes the process of going from having a basic idea to thoroughly thinking through the twists and turns it might take over the next five or ten years.   It involves everything from user research to scenario planning and addressing myriad questions about how the idea will play out in the market.  So, what's crucial is the founder's skill in working through this idea maze.   The best entrepreneurs excel at navigating the complexities, understanding the details, and anticipating problems that might arise.   They delve into a thousand questions, from potential use cases to market dynamics, app development, partnerships, pricing, and more.   It's like solving a maze where they sometimes hit dead ends and must backtrack, adapt, and reconfigure their idea.  Great founders have essentially worked through this maze even before officially starting their company.   They demonstrate a keen understanding of the challenges ahead and have a better chance of successfully bringing their idea to fruition by anticipating and addressing potential roadblocks.""  .

Ask them what they need, will pay for  and if they want YOU to build it.  3. They said 'Yes' to your idea!!!  4. Build an MVP version with no-code tools.  5. Sell it to people who would truly benefit from it. The feedback you get from them is 100X more valuable than the revenue.  But don't be afraid to charge; paying customers are the only true validation.  6. Try to build a community around your product if you can (not compulsory).  7. 'Iterate, Iterate & Iterate' - until you achieve product-market fit.  8. Now it's time to scale. See what processes you can automate with AI.  Your tech stack is:  - LLMs - AI agents - Zapier/Make - No-code tools (Voiceflow, Stack AI, Airtable ....)  Consider yourself successful if you manage to automate 70% of a task.   Now figure out the parts where AI needs to be told what to do and how to do it by a HUMAN. That role is what you need to hire for.  9. Now that you know how many employees you need and for what roles, hire the absolute best: people who are smarter and better than you.  10. Play as a team.  11. CRUSH it!!  Starting a startup has never been easier. On the other hand, competition has never been so fierce. Only having a good product is not enough anymore.  ""Mediocre product + Great Distribution"" beats ""Great Product + Weak Distribution"". And this is the basic essence of this post.  I hope it helps if you are at the beginning of your startup journey or in the early stages.  If you enjoyed this post, I'd really appreciate it if you would:  1.

https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1733151987892449699#m,"7 free startup ideas worth $1M-$1B   1 - A fitness gym that costs $0/month to join. Flip the model on it's head. Charge nothing to join, but upsell on premium classes, smoothies, access to steam/sauna. You could even sell advertising to local businesses. It's a quick way to bootstrap a community. Question I have with this one - what niche could it be in (Crossfit, strength training etc)?  2 - Spotify but for music thats ""work in progress"". When you browse Spotify or Apple Music, it's all the music that's perfected for the album that's been published. But what about the music that artists have in draft mode? Would be so cool to take part in this journey with them. Soundcloud was this for a minute, but it's lost its way. How would you monetize this?  3 - The Penguin Random House but for fiction books powered by AI. We're going to see authors that are just AI in 2024. Idea generation, marketing, design all completed via AI. You could write a script that create books based on Instagram or Pinterest trends (see my breakdown of the 2024 Pinterest report here), designs it in a beautiful aesthetic, uploads it to Amazon and you start selling. Imagine creating 1 book a week with this formula and over time building a portfolio of these cash-flowing books. Forget your 401k, you're retirment plans is your 401 self-published AI books.  4 - Stripe Atlas but for shutting down companies. Shutting down a company is no fun. You're already probably in a bad mood, heartbroken that your baby has failed, the last thing you want to do is be flooded with paperwork and figuring out dissolution documents. Stripe Atlas made it easy for anyone to start a business. But where is the Stripe Atlas for shutting them down?  5- Twitter Spaces for Uber drivers. A private social network for gig workers. They can hop on in their local areas and chat with drivers. You monetize this by affiliate deals. Maybe an Uber acquires this one day.  6- Twitch meets Church. Live video/social network around being spiritual. The feeling of a mega church in an app with really sleek social features. Monetize via premium features like dating etc. Half of American Gen-Z don't believe in religion but lots are spiritual, so I wonder if an app they can tune into on their couch might spike their interest.  7 - AI Accountability bots. When someone holds you accountable, you're more likely to complete the tasks. We all know this. People will pay for accountability around working out, work, hobbies etc. A business that charges $29/month for access to an AI bot coach that keeps you in check. Probably wildly effective and way cheaper for the customer than hiring a person. Win-win?

In the past, I've had a few good ideas that I started working on that I eventually let drop by the wayside, but that other folks iterated on and turned into big businesses over several years.  It's easy to let that happen when you don't have a lot of conviction or vision around the way the world is going to look in the future, or if you're chasing fast/quick growth.  I'm working hard to not let that be me this time around.  I have a really clear idea of how the SaaS world is going to look and evolve into, maybe because I've been in it for so long, and I'm also enjoying building the thing that I think will be necessary for all SaaS companies in the future.  Most importantly, I'm positioning myself well to be able to continue working on something for the long term.  So one of my unfair advantages will just end up being longevity.","Dec 18, 2023 · 1:55 PM UTC",0,0

Are there additional regulatory issues to consider?
