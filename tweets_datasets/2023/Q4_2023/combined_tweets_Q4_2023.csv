https://twitter.com/StartupArchive_/status/1737093268884558247#m,"OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor explains why platform shifts are a fruitful source of startup ideas  Bret Taylor is now the chairman of OpenAI. Before that, he co-created Google Maps, co-founded FriendFeed (sold to Facebook for $50M), was the CTO of Facebook, co-founded Quip (sold to Salesforce for $750M), and was the co-CEO of Salesforce.  In the clip below he explains that when deciding what to work on next, he will often ask himself “when this platform exists, what habits will change?”  He believes that platform shifts are large drivers of economic value. For example, the PC led to the creation of Microsoft and Apple, and the Internet gave rise to companies like Amazon and Google.  “The reason I believe platform shifts are meaningful is that it changes the balance of power between incumbents and startups. It was very hard to compete with Microsoft on PCs because they practically owned the entire stack. But in the age of the smartphone, it was a completely different story because they don’t control the operating system, they don’t control the hardware, and all of a sudden you’re on slightly more equal footing with these very powerful incumbents. And your agility as a startup and your native understanding of the platform can outweigh their strength in finances and employees.”  At this @StartupGrind event in 2018, he posits that mobile will be the biggest platform shift for a while and that AI has the capability of doing that but “it’s just sort of early days.”  ""When you're thinking of startup ideas, going to the rising tide that will lift your boat is definitely a good starting point. It's a very broad direction, but I do think people often choose a niche and don't think through why their startup will succeed versus incumbents. It's really important to think about that strategically.""","Dec 19, 2023 · 12:51 PM UTC",221,6

It's like HTML/CSS but for mobile apps.  And we combine it with an efficient work process.  Our work process:  1. Onboarding call  We discuss your ideas and learn about your product. The head of design gives audits about potential problems and assigns the tasks to designers.  2. Wireframing  In a single day, we plan out how your app will behave.  3. Coding  Only 7 days to build an app with technical requirements.  4. UI iterations  At this stage, we are ready to make your app look perfect.  5. Deployment  The app is ready to onboard the first clients and gather information about necessary fixes.  ---  Of course, polishing the app takes more than 7-9 days.  But...  With our method, you can:  – Save months or even years of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars for the V1 MVP release – Get access to top-tier coders and designers without hiring and onboarding. – Get ready to raise money because you have a working solution  ---  We have one spot left this month to make your idea into a product.  ---  – Drew from Infinite Shelf Design","Dec 19, 2023 · 1:22 PM UTC",49,5

""Ability of founder to navigate through the Idea Maze""  Marc Andreessen shared a perspective on what he looks for in a startup founder -   ""When meeting a founder, what we're looking for is their ability to navigate the ""idea maze."" This term, coined by our partner, describes the process of going from having a basic idea to thoroughly thinking through the twists and turns it might take over the next five or ten years.   It involves everything from user research to scenario planning and addressing myriad questions about how the idea will play out in the market.  So, what's crucial is the founder's skill in working through this idea maze.   The best entrepreneurs excel at navigating the complexities, understanding the details, and anticipating problems that might arise.   They delve into a thousand questions, from potential use cases to market dynamics, app development, partnerships, pricing, and more.   It's like solving a maze where they sometimes hit dead ends and must backtrack, adapt, and reconfigure their idea.  Great founders have essentially worked through this maze even before officially starting their company.   They demonstrate a keen understanding of the challenges ahead and have a better chance of successfully bringing their idea to fruition by anticipating and addressing potential roadblocks.""  .

Ask them what they need, will pay for  and if they want YOU to build it.  3. They said 'Yes' to your idea!!!  4. Build an MVP version with no-code tools.  5. Sell it to people who would truly benefit from it. The feedback you get from them is 100X more valuable than the revenue.  But don't be afraid to charge; paying customers are the only true validation.  6. Try to build a community around your product if you can (not compulsory).  7. 'Iterate, Iterate & Iterate' - until you achieve product-market fit.  8. Now it's time to scale. See what processes you can automate with AI.  Your tech stack is:  - LLMs - AI agents - Zapier/Make - No-code tools (Voiceflow, Stack AI, Airtable ....)  Consider yourself successful if you manage to automate 70% of a task.   Now figure out the parts where AI needs to be told what to do and how to do it by a HUMAN. That role is what you need to hire for.  9. Now that you know how many employees you need and for what roles, hire the absolute best: people who are smarter and better than you.  10. Play as a team.  11. CRUSH it!!  Starting a startup has never been easier. On the other hand, competition has never been so fierce. Only having a good product is not enough anymore.  ""Mediocre product + Great Distribution"" beats ""Great Product + Weak Distribution"". And this is the basic essence of this post.  I hope it helps if you are at the beginning of your startup journey or in the early stages.  If you enjoyed this post, I'd really appreciate it if you would:  1.

https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1733151987892449699#m,"7 free startup ideas worth $1M-$1B   1 - A fitness gym that costs $0/month to join. Flip the model on it's head. Charge nothing to join, but upsell on premium classes, smoothies, access to steam/sauna. You could even sell advertising to local businesses. It's a quick way to bootstrap a community. Question I have with this one - what niche could it be in (Crossfit, strength training etc)?  2 - Spotify but for music thats ""work in progress"". When you browse Spotify or Apple Music, it's all the music that's perfected for the album that's been published. But what about the music that artists have in draft mode? Would be so cool to take part in this journey with them. Soundcloud was this for a minute, but it's lost its way. How would you monetize this?  3 - The Penguin Random House but for fiction books powered by AI. We're going to see authors that are just AI in 2024. Idea generation, marketing, design all completed via AI. You could write a script that create books based on Instagram or Pinterest trends (see my breakdown of the 2024 Pinterest report here), designs it in a beautiful aesthetic, uploads it to Amazon and you start selling. Imagine creating 1 book a week with this formula and over time building a portfolio of these cash-flowing books. Forget your 401k, you're retirment plans is your 401 self-published AI books.  4 - Stripe Atlas but for shutting down companies. Shutting down a company is no fun. You're already probably in a bad mood, heartbroken that your baby has failed, the last thing you want to do is be flooded with paperwork and figuring out dissolution documents. Stripe Atlas made it easy for anyone to start a business. But where is the Stripe Atlas for shutting them down?  5- Twitter Spaces for Uber drivers. A private social network for gig workers. They can hop on in their local areas and chat with drivers. You monetize this by affiliate deals. Maybe an Uber acquires this one day.  6- Twitch meets Church. Live video/social network around being spiritual. The feeling of a mega church in an app with really sleek social features. Monetize via premium features like dating etc. Half of American Gen-Z don't believe in religion but lots are spiritual, so I wonder if an app they can tune into on their couch might spike their interest.  7 - AI Accountability bots. When someone holds you accountable, you're more likely to complete the tasks. We all know this. People will pay for accountability around working out, work, hobbies etc. A business that charges $29/month for access to an AI bot coach that keeps you in check. Probably wildly effective and way cheaper for the customer than hiring a person. Win-win?

In the past, I've had a few good ideas that I started working on that I eventually let drop by the wayside, but that other folks iterated on and turned into big businesses over several years.  It's easy to let that happen when you don't have a lot of conviction or vision around the way the world is going to look in the future, or if you're chasing fast/quick growth.  I'm working hard to not let that be me this time around.  I have a really clear idea of how the SaaS world is going to look and evolve into, maybe because I've been in it for so long, and I'm also enjoying building the thing that I think will be necessary for all SaaS companies in the future.  Most importantly, I'm positioning myself well to be able to continue working on something for the long term.  So one of my unfair advantages will just end up being longevity.","Dec 18, 2023 · 1:55 PM UTC",0,0

Are there additional regulatory issues to consider?

Thousands have failed with the exact same idea. 7- Because you need to focus on what really matters and work without restrictions. 8- Because you don’t have the answers, your market does.

En Actiage tenemos muchos (¡muchisimos! no hemos dejado de testar cosas) de los primeros y unos pocos de los segundos…  De este último grupo, destaca que desde el principio entendimos que una de las claves del éxito pasaría por crear productos y servicios excepcionalmente buenos y totalmente diferentes a lo que hacen otras empresas.  Al fin y al cabo, si tienes recursos limitados no parece buena idea ofrecer lo mismo que todo el mundo, aunque esto suponga explorar nuevos caminos y enfrentarse a mayores niveles de incertidumbre (y no pocas veces, de incomprensión).  Así, priorizamos nuestros recursos en la diferenciación, concibiendo productos y servicios desde la necesidad de nuestros usuarios y no guiándonos por lo que hacen otros agentes del mercado.  Como resultado, el boca-oreja ha sido el principal motor de nuestro crecimiento, muy por delante de cualquier fuente.  Porque prácticamente toda persona que ha probado uno de nuestros tratamientos o suplementos nutricionales, nos recomienda. Y, con cada recomendación, empieza nuevamente el ciclo.  Tenemos muchísimas anécdotas en este sentido. Recomendaciones entre amigos, hijos que compran para sus padres, personas que compran para otras que por las razones que sean no pueden hacerlo por sí mismas, compradores en el extranjero….  Pero algunas personas no sólo nos recomiendan sino que también se convierten en auténticos fans que empiezan a “conversar” contigo sobre una pasión y una visión común, que en nuestro caso no es otro que el de disfrutar de mayores niveles de salud a largo plazo.  Conversaciones que a lo largo del tiempo se transforman en una relación más profunda donde te das cuenta lo mucho que se tiene en común y cómo juntos se puede impactar de una mejor manera en este mundo.  Y esto es lo que nos pasó con Patricia… y no podemos estar más felices de que se nos haya unido para que más personas disfruten de una longevidad más larga y saludable.","Dec 1, 2023 · 8:14 AM UTC",1,0

Elon Musk's start-up Neuralink aims to install brain chips in up to 11 people in 2024, with thousands of volunteers having lined up to take part.  Research by Foresight Factory suggests that more than a third of consumers (35%) would be willing to have such a chip implanted, in order to connect directly to computer systems. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently gave Neuralink approval to begin human trials, after initially refusing it.  Neuralink, which launched in 2016, is centred on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, and has already implanted chips successfully in mice, pigs and monkeys.

I thought  I would build something out of college, drop out and maybe apply for the Thiel Fellowship :)  But only if start-up journey were so certain and predictable. That idea eventually failed. Actually, we failed at the execution part to be really honest.   But I tasted the thrill of building a company and we couldn't wait but  start another one in healthcare domain.  And we served thousands of users, we raised angel and pre-seed  funding while being in college and still building @HealthTick  with the same enthusiasms.  It was named Yoboshu Cares in the start.  Well, if anyone here building out of college, here's my top-3 learnings.   - Startups take huge amount of time and energy, make sure you can manage with your academic.(Until and unless you are certain to drop out)  -Your grades and social life will almost certainly suffer. (I know the pain to manage a decent grade while still working on Yoboshu Cares.

Don't train one until you've proven product market fit.  The beauty of the flourishing A.I. API ecosystem is you can get to market with your product very quickly. You should use an existing API to get an MVP out the door as quickly as possible.   When your idea gains some traction, start collecting data. Figure out how to best structure it and start vacuuming up as much as you can.  When you start to meaningfully scale with proven PMF along with a large dataset, then we will talk about training a model.   ...and odds are, no, you won't need to pay OpenAI $2-3m to get a model trained. There is almost certainly a smaller open source model that you can train to be an expert in your use-case.  Now get back to shipping!","Nov 9, 2023 · 6:41 PM UTC",2,0

They have so many locations these days: https://www.antler.co/location. And if you don't want Antler - google for ""startup accelerators"" and pick the one you like.  What you'll need: ✅ Some sort of an interview, evaluating yourself (and idea, if you have it) ✅ Means to sustain yourself through the program.  ℹ Investments from accelerators are typically not the biggest ones, but they are investing in ""idea on a napkin"" and most important - help you to find your co-founders.  ⏩ If you want to skip and go for funding directly - look for an early-stage VC or angel investors. Again, simple Google query like ""list of vc funds per industry"" will give you a link like that one: https://openvc.app/blog/vc-list, where you will see a spreadsheet like that: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRdFZhXLqat04xe7qO-p48wXQ00GWJyrzgHSb3YVIp0/edit?pli=1#gid=0  And then it's just reaching out to those you like or as many as you can persevere. Yep, that's what I also did, I swear!  What you'll need: ✅ A pitch-deck with about 10 slides or less, including: problem, solution, market analysis, plans for 6-12-18 months, business model, team (or yourself), competitors, your ask and where those funds will take you ✅ Your own charisma to stand behind the idea  I know it's really difficult, as otherwise everyone would be doing it, but many would be surprised, how actually simple it is 😄  Go for it! 💪","Nov 6, 2023 · 7:33 PM UTC",0,0

I brought up what I thought was a wonderful idea at the time (trading forex for people in exchange for some commissions on the profit) to her. And in a few sentences, she let me know how dumb my plan was. She was nice about it but the truth is that a dumb idea is a dumb idea.  I gave her examples of people who were doing it then and offered a full-throttled defense of my business plan. She smiled, shook her head in a motherly way, and said “well, you asked for my opinion, didn’t you?” I left her office, tossed my plan in the trash bin and it was one of the best financial, time management and mental health decisions I made in grad school. Within months, those I thought were successful turned out to be Ponzi schemes. All of them failed, leaving financial, reputational and relationship ruin in their wake. The reasons she told me (which I have omitted for sake of brevity) have been validated time and again.  This post is not about Ponzi schemes, it’s not even about business plans. It’s about the fact that when you respect someone enough to ask for their opinion, and they are gracious enough to give it to you, take it. They know more than you. They have seen more than you. Trust what you see in them not what you think the right answer is.","Nov 4, 2023 · 6:38 PM UTC",810,21

https://twitter.com/david_seroy/status/1710882528809357355#m,"Saturday night musings.   Here's a free #Bitcoin start-up/business idea, with details, on how to create a vastly improved @hodlwithLedn and @unchainedcom. To be clear, I immensely respect these companies, but they leave much to be desired and it annoys me something better doesn't exist. This is low hanging fruit IMO.  Everyone knows Bitcoin backed borrowing has gargantuan PMF (why sell when you can borrow against BTC), but the above companies are expensive as F*** and have major limitations because they're built on legacy fiat rails.  However, recently #Bitcoin backed borrowing models using smart contracts on Bitcoin side-chains like @SovrynBTC and @fuji_money are 10X improvements primarily because you can borrow bitcoin-backed Stablecoins at 0% interest, in perpetuity, with way better LTV and liquidation terms than centralized solutions (See: https://wiki.sovryn.com/en/sovryn-dapp/subprotocols/zero-zusd).   Unfortunately, no one cares nor uses these protocols for a couple of reasons, which I detail below. If you alleviate these issues: 1. regulatory/tax, 2. custody, 3. off-ramping to fiat, you create a pretty clean and potentially very profitable business.  To be clear, the business is building a centralized company on-top of these decentralized protocols, but fixing the barriers to entry, which will lubricate mass adoption and profitability.  Step 1 -- Legal & Tax: Customers need to have comfort they're not doing anything illegal, and operating with 'DeFi' protocols can be kind of sketch. You need to get letters from credible attorney's and CPA's that can reasonably justify that: 1) Swapping to BTC on a sidechain does not trigger a taxable sale.  2) Borrowing against BTC via protocols is not taxable.   Realistically, both of these are grey areas, so take a similar approach to Unchained and have a page with letters that say look there's no clear answer, but here's our due diligence from credible people and their opinions: https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-loans-and-taxes/. You'd also need to consult attorney about potential money transmitter license, KYC, and other applicable licenses that may be needed, probably just NMLS. No major barriers afaict.  Step 2 -- Custody: Find a legit custody provider who would support Bitcoin and the sidechain which the DeFi protocols live on (RSK or Liquid). Maybe @TheyaBitcoin, maybe @CasaHODL maybe @cryptoAPI, maybe @Swan Vault. You definitely don't want to build this solution or take this responsibility. Trust the bigger players. @PeteThePlanner who else can be recommended?  Step 3 -- Build app with simple back-end. Literally only 3 things:  1)  Holds #BTC in cold-storage on-chain.   2) Holds wrapped #BTC on the side-chain for when it's pledged as collateral in the smart contract. 3) Holds stablecoins.   Fortunately. all of this in can be out-sourced using pre-existing API's and infrastructure from the custody solution in Step 2 (assuming you have a strong provider) and then the SDK's from the DeFi apps on the side-chains to integrate with the smart contracts  Step 4 -- Raise an investment fund. This is probably the most unique but potentially the most profitable part. The primary down-fall of these DeFi BTC borrow protocols is when you borrow, you get a new stablecoin instead of popular ones like USDC or USDT. And then people say OK great I borrowed this stablecoin at 0% interest, now WTF do I do with this. They of course want to swap it for more popular fiat backed stables that can be bridged out. So, until and unless the new stablecoin gains adoption you need a corresponding party to bring traditional dollar liquidity that is willing to swap and facilitate the bridge out. Because there is so much demand to make these swaps it can be quite profitable to facilitate the trade. For example a user often times is willing to pay a 1-3% fee just to get USDT from the BTC stablecoin (this can be seen as an implied interest rate or cost to the borrow, despite the actual borrowing being 0% interest). Ultimately, the purpose of the fund is to use dollars raised to facilitate the swap of $1 of fiat backed stablecoins for a premium of the BTC stables. The fund can sit in Treasuries or a MMF, then deploy the dollars as swaps for the BTC stablecoins and collect easy profit.  Further, the next question is wtf does the fund do with these BTC stables? And fortunately, they do have other use cases. Primarily they are used to perform liquidations on BTC loans that go bad. For example, if BTC price drops and $1M loan goes bad, then $1M of the BTC stables from a liquidation pool are burned and in return the liquidation pool receives $1.1M of the BTC that was put up as collateral. This can be very lucrative during times of distress as funds can be recycled and collect many liquidations. Back-testing estimates show anywhere from 12%-120% APY with average coming in around 35% APY.  To recap, you raise money in a fund using a Reg D SEC structure (consult a securities attorney, obviously). Sit on treasuries, swap the fiat dollars for BTC dollars as needed and collect margin, sit those BTC dollars in the liquidation pool, wait for price volatility, collect the spread on the liquidations, realize the gains immediately (or just sit on BTC) and pay-out your very happy investors. @DAAF17 would you guys place capital in something like this?  Step 5 -- Charge a small premium for your services. Specifically, while the protocol charges 0% interest, you could charge a few hundred bips of interest or a few points on origination on-top for the services and UX. In aggregate, from soup to nuts there are several costs to consider here and it wouldn't technically be 0% interest loans, but even still there appears to be so much room that a significant fraction below the cost of competitors is easily attainable.  Step 6 - Run a profitable company or sell to a big player. Natively on-chain financial services on BTC are going to be a huge thing into the future. I already know for a fact, other large players are trying to get into this space. But they're too busy or don't know how to build this out themselves. Which is why I am publishing this here.   Other notes: - This business could exist right now and Day 1 be making profit. The tech currently exists and is in production. - Very, low over-head business. - Primary risks are of course smart contract and *quasi* decentralization related. However, there is good reason to believe these contracts are quite battle-tested.  --  If you're a legit full-stack developer and want to co-found. I can be convinced @Martellfox know anyone? Otherwise, I hope someone else takes it, steals my idea and does it themselves. The community deserves these products.  For context, the prior venture I founded and sold was an asset backed lending company. There are a lot of parallels I see.  Where does this idea fail and who is going to build it?","Oct 8, 2023 · 4:59 AM UTC",34,13

https://twitter.com/arestaurant_guy/status/1737176699396112747#m,"What I hope to see from a salesman who is trying to get our business:  1) Come prepared.  Have at least an idea of what our menu is, because pitching Chinese food to a sports bar just doesn't make sense.  2) Don't bash our current supplier.  I use them for a reason.  I trust them more than I trust someone off the street. You don't have any upside with me by doing this.  3) I don't want to be pitched a random item if we haven't met before.  I'm sure you have great meat and I'm sure you have a great IPA. I don't care, everyone does.   Start by asking us about what we're looking for and follow up next week with what we talk about.  4) Don't stop in during peak hours, unless you have reason to believe we're slow.  An unsolicited sales pitch during lunch isn't going to do anything but piss me off, especially if we've never met.  5) If you come in for lunch with a friend & I'm your server, and you've spent the last month trying to get my business, you damn well better leave a tip. I do not care about the $5.  I do care about how you act in a restaurant (and, yes, this actually happened).  6) If I ask for a quote on a dozen items, and you promise me you'll have it done by Friday, then I need it by Friday.  If you flake out on the first agreement we make together, you're going to flake on the rest of our relationship as well.  7) Eventually you're going to have to offer something I can't get with my current suppliers.  They are the incumbent.  The incumbent has a huge advantage.  If I'm even marginally happy with my current supplier, I need to think I have upside with you-because switching from something that works is nothing but downside.  8) Don't talk down to my staff.  I've seen this.  Instant, irreversible turn off.  As I read through all of this, it basically comes down to this: build trust. There's many ways to do this, but there's just as many ways to lose it.

https://twitter.com/sebastianvolkis/status/1736896534501867695#m,"Controversial opinion. Use Bubble to build your SaaS.    Why? Because for every billion dollar idea you have, 10,000 other people had the same idea, and are building it right now.  Are you in this to make money? Build a business? Work for yourself? Become your own boss? Retire? Quit your job?   OR are you in this because you like Javascript?  Whatever your motivation is, he who is first, wins.  No code is a game-changer for rapid market entry and product validation.  Here's the deal: Only code after confirming market demand for your app.  Why this approach? Because, despite what a lot of founders/devs think, saas is just like any other business.   Supply and demand, but this time the supply is the lack of a solution for a problem a lot of people have.  And the competition is a lot more fierce. You're up against the best in the business.  Consider this: Your 'billion-dollar SaaS concept' could take over half a year to develop traditionally. But with Bubble, you're ahead in mere weeks.  And, let's face it, even your great aunt has 3 multi billion dollar app ideas a day, so whats to say yours is any different?  What's your fallback when traditional coding and months of work lead to a dead end?  Passion for coding is great, but it doesn't pay bills.   Customers won't flock to your app because you have the best tech stack.  Yet, with no-code tools, you can carve a niche, outmanoeuvre competitors, and craft a thriving business.  A lot of the time you can get quite far with your bubble MVP, you can monetise it, build a scalable business, and then, once you hit your revenue goals, develop it properly/hire someone.  Too many founders get stuck in the mindset that they need to have everything self coded because ""Bubble reduces exit value"" or ""I don't own my product"".  When in reality, the dude buying your business cares about 2 things:  1) TTM Profit 2) Market size  If they see good numbers in these two things, then your business is worth something.   Maybe slightly lower multiplier if its in no code, but at least you have a product with paying users.   Because while Nathan is googling how to centre a div, you've launched an MVP and are already scooping up market share.  The moral of this is, if you spend 6-12 months building, someone will always get there first.   The person who wins, is the one who gets there first.  It worked for me, why wouldnt it work for you.","Dec 18, 2023 · 11:49 PM UTC",24,5

He's just selling the dream that you can go pick 10-30 stocks in certain valuation ranges and outperform  Efficient market theory didn't debunk that you can find individual securities that outperform, but it absolutely debunked the philosophy that Joel Greenblatt is teaching in this article:   The philosophy that you can just buy groups of stocks in certain valuation ranges and show actual outperformance  If you average 2 separate groups of people or 2 groups of stocks based off any amount of identity characteristics, their averaged behavior will be guaranteed to be different in any measured characteristic. This is why you don't want to evaluate groups more than ""I'll look through the things below book value"" and then you're still making your investment decisions completely on individuality and on a combination of qualitative and quantitive factors  You can't do that when you just consider quantitive factors, therefore you can't really complete the process, in the way Warren Buffett would teach investing, to make investing decisions to ever expect to outperform  Joel Greenblatt doesn't attack the right part of efficient market theory, which is to attack the nature of what makes a business a business, through qualitative factors that can't be written down and predicted with algorithms that only see numbers  In summary: I think he way too often teaches the misguided philosophy that there's something to learn from screens through historical valuation ranges without looking at actual business factors such as ""where's the business at and what does that mean"", ""Who runs the business"", etc, etc...","Dec 19, 2023 · 8:00 PM UTC",54,16

But unexpected things have happened as well.  1) I didn't expect that so many people would take it seriously, it was an overwhelming undertaking to respond in detail to 80 different business ideas 😅  2) Out of the handful of people that I picked while being very selective, everyone that I've had a call with so far has that secret sauce. They're motivated, ambitious, organised, creative, and prepared to sacrifice in exchange for success. You don't come across these people normally. If I was looking for someone like this to hire it would be close to impossible, but through this process of elimination it has brought them to the forefront. They also remind me of me when I was first starting out as an extremely hungry young entrepreneur, which brought back a lot of early day memories of suffering and success.  3) I am only investing in one person and being their advisor. However, since I didn't expect to be as impressed by the people as I am, it crossed my mind that even if they don't receive investment from me to become an entrepreneur, I would be very happy to work with them as an intrapreneur within my companies.  To wrap up, I have just a few more calls to make with everyone so far to complete Stage 2 and then once I'm satisfied that I've gotten to know everyone and their ideas well enough, I will pick the ultimate winner.

https://twitter.com/IAmChrisDale/status/1737205339064598777#m,"6 years ago I started my business.  I had no idea what I was doing (and I had bills to pay).  Today, I’ve made over £30,000,000 revenue with my business.  These 20 lessons will teach you more than a 4-year business degree:  1. There is no get-rich-quick scheme. You need a mixture of hard work, patience and a great idea.  2. Set a large goal and reverse engineer it. Breaking your goals down into bite-sized chunks can make success more achievable in the short and long-term.  3. Trust your gut instinct. If you go against it and it doesn’t work out you will regret it.  4. Get a mentor or coach who has done what you want to do. Make sure you have someone to share experiences, ideas and feedback with.  5. Family have their place in this journey, but don’t rely on them for anything other than support.  6. Make sure you know who your target market is. Make it specific.  7. Sell a service rather than a product. The upside and pitfalls are much better for a service offering.  8. A CEO is the answer to all questions. The solver of all problems. The head of all departments. Be the expert.  9. Prepare for the first years of the business to be selfish and time-consuming. Find balance where you can.  10. Doing the easy things is not actually easy. You need to work at it every day.  11. Concentrate on the small wins. Eventually the big wins take care of themselves.  12. Fight for every deal, no matter how lost it seems.  13. Setting up a company to make a difference will be the best option in the short and long term. Don’t just do it for the money.  14. If you own the company, you’re accountable for everything. Embrace this mindset.  15. Work ethic and talent are the two drivers of hiring success. Make sure you recruit well.  16. Failure can be acceptable. Excuses are not. Make sure you identify both.  17. When you finish a year, make time for an honest review to reflect. This is the perfect time to make changes.  18. Assess your success at all possible opportunities and listen to external feedback from clients at all times.  19. You are what your record says at the end of the day, regardless of how hard you try.  20. Build a business for the future as well as the present. Make long-term relationships that can benefit the company in future years.","Dec 19, 2023 · 8:16 PM UTC",45,2

So I asked it the following:  ""Suggest some profitable low cost online business ideas (with a focus on content sites and blogs, software, Apss, eCommerce, email newsletters, social media, affiliate marketing) that have untapped opportunities based on these niche ideas...""  And I provided it with a list of the most commonly view niche report pages on the NicheNirvana website as you can see.  I didn't expect to get much useful back from it if I'm honest but it surprised me, here's what it gave me...  The Advice for Nurses idea are exactly the same ideas I would give myself - spot on ChatGPT.  The Coding Skills for Kids ideas are great I think because I hadn't thought about an interactive App but that would work really well.  Here's some of the other business ideas ChatGPT gave me...  The Adjustable Beds ideas make total sense though I had asked for low cost ideas and that's likely to be expensive, but I list some affiliate programs on the report on the NicheNirvana website so you could go down the affiliate site route.   The Air Fryers idea for an affiliate site or a recipe app makes perfect sense, check out the report on the NicheNirvana website to see the top selling products on Amazon and elsewhere.   And the Baby Health Trackers too - an app or content site would be perfect, I list many content sites on the NicheNirvana website in this niche report.   What else did it suggest?  The Brazilian Beauty one is spot on as many of the products in that niche are natural and organic though it wouldn't neccessarily be low cost but you could create an affiliate site instead (tip: Sol De Janeiro a Brazilian Beauty eCom brand is one of ShareASale's top earning affiliate programs, check out the report on the NicheNirvana website for this niche!)  Cat Training ideas are spot on too and there's some already very successful Cat Training courses and products on Clickbank that pay up to 75% commission - and I know from personal experience they convert (they are listed on the Cat Training report on the NicheNirvana website by the way)  For Cowboy Clothing that was the only real options it was likely to suggest but it wouldn't be low cost exactly as I specified but instead of an eCom play turn it into an affiliate site - you'd be surprised at how many affiliate programs there are in this niche (just check out the report on NicheNirvana website to see)  Due to Twitter limiting the number of images to 4 per thread I'll continue in the comments with the rest of the ideas, so keep reading...","Dec 18, 2023 · 9:19 PM UTC",21,3

Well I asked it to provide me with a list of the ""greatest business ideas"" in 2024 for someone with a budget of $1000 or less.  Here's what it suggested...  Print on Demand is certainly lower cost than a lot of  business ideas as you can outsource the printing elsewhere if you find an audience for it, so that's not a bad idea but it's also quite a saturated area IMO.  Dropshipping likewise allows you to get started with little capital but I feel like it's soooooo saturated on Amazon these days and starting your own brand will be tough so not sure this is an amazing idea, it's kinda been done to death already IMO.  That was literally the only 2 opportunities it offered me which is kinda limited and poor tbh.  It also provided some basic and generic steps to get started which I don't think are overly useful due to their lack of detail or nuance.  Then this funny little comment at the end reminding us that success may not happen overnight and you have to continually improve.   Thanks for the reminder ChatGPT as we thought you could get rich overnight with no skills, lol!  Personally I'm giving ChatGPT a 3/10 at best for this one as I feel it gave too few ideas and none of them are really new plus I feel like POD and Dropshipping are more difficult to get into compared to content sites or other business models and quite saturated.  Those wouldn't be my top picks for 2024 booming, low cost, businesses.

https://twitter.com/nellyagbogu/status/1737004148308967485#m,"DO NOT SLEEP ON THAT BIG BUSINESS IDEA IN 2024!  Sis, true life story.  During their University days, Uchenna was known as the business mogul of his department.  This guy has sold anything saleable while on campus, from term papers, handout, assignments, just guess, he has sold them all.  At one time in school, a lecturer gave them an assignment where they will use toads as their specimen for an experiment.  The whole class was in turmoil, where will they get toads for over 200 people in a department for experiment.  The grumbling was on another level, some said the lecturer was heartless, others said the lecturer was unreasonable.  But for Uchenna, he saw a business opportunity there, so he went out and contacted some villagers.  He told them he would give them N500 for each of the toads, they agreed, he went to his department and told his mates that one toad is N2500.  Uchenna made 2k from each toad for over 200 people in a department.   Do the maths…  He made this much, because he didn't sleep on the idea.  At a different time,   He noticed that the guys in his hostel were so much in need of groceries and floating berries (if you know you know).  But he felt selling garri and groundnuts was never his thing. The market was there, the need was glaring, but he kept analysing.  (Lesson; do not be emotional about a business that has a ready market)  He came back one noon from lectures, and discovered that someone had started his groceries and floating berries business.  It pained him so deep that he vowed never to sleep on any idea in his head.   When he left school, he got into the knowledge economy where he was selling courses.  One of those days, he had the idea to teach copywriting for beginners.  Today he has taught over 40 editions of that class using WhatsApp and has made over N150M teaching copywriting for beginners.   One biggest mistake many business owners make is to feel like the idea they got for their business is uniquely theirs asin “God placed it in their heart for them alone”  No!  That idea is also placed in millions of hearts!  What matters is ”WHO IS EXECUTING?”  Have you ever wondered why you and your team/friend may be talking about putting out the next big thing and bam!  You open your social media and realise that your “next big thing” idea has already been brought to life by your rival …  When you realise your ideas are not uniquely yours, you will focus on execution instead of daydreaming.  Prepare to be BIG on executing your ideas next year.  Make a commitment to yourself with these words.  I will execute my big ideas next year.  Thank You!   PS: Take a look at the woman that born me. Please don't ask why she is fair and i am dark.   #naijabrandchick","Dec 19, 2023 · 6:57 AM UTC",66,9

You might receive inquiries even after a year, as they won't get lost in the constant stream of 'recent' online content.  Offline marketing can offer great value within your budget.  Here are some ideas:  * Business Cards:  Yes, they are still relevant! Always carry a few business cards in your pocket. Give them to friends, relatives, and people you've had brief conversations with. Don't hesitate, as these cards represent your business socially. The cost is similar to a one-month subscription for 1,000 cards. Keep it simple – your business and contact information. Don't forget to include a 'Thank You' note and express your appreciation for recommendations.  * Letterheads and Envelopes:  They have a broad reach as they pass through multiple hands. People often pay attention to details at the bottom. You can send covers to potential addresses with a welcoming message on letterheads and a business card enclosed.  * Brochures: Design brochures that suit your industry, focusing on informative content. Distribute them to potential leads or inquiries. They provide a quick overview of your business and might sit on someone's desk for years. They could also serve as an alternative if their current provider falters.  * Banners:  Not suitable for everyone, but if you have spaces for small 3x2 framed flex banners, they can be effective on the road.  * Flyers and Pamphlets:  Flyers can serve the same purpose as brochures or advertise specific offers in larger quantities. Distribute thousands of prints across a large area at a low cost for guaranteed impressions. Great for festival or seasonal offers – for distribution there are lots off-the-book ideas!  * Stickers:  Useful for reports, files, and other stationery. Print stickers with basic details and use them on files and stationery items. Or bigger ones for Walls :) can be a poster for your ad.  * Newspaper:  Place ads in local weeklies to quickly attract business and remind the neighborhood of your presence. You can focus on city-wise placements depending on your target audience.  * Demo Tent:  Perfect for product marketing, especially for businesses involving tools or 'How To' demonstrations. All you need is space, a well-designed tent, and your best customer executive. Invite some friends to make it enjoyable.  * Other Potential Ad Placements:  Explore printed apparel, point-of-sale displays, signage, billing stationery, car/truck wraps, and calendars.  * Costlier Ideas:  Consider sponsoring events, teams, festivities, and community causes. Hosting small events at your place is also an option. Events planners can provide tailored ideas based on your business, although these options might involve larger investments.  Now, if you need assistance with any of the above, that's what I'm here for! I can handle everything from content creation to final printing and other related tasks. Stress-free and following the standard procedures of the designer-client agreement :)  Have a fantastic day!","Aug 26, 2023 · 8:49 AM UTC",6,0
