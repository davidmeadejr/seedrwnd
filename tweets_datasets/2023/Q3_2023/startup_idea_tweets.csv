https://twitter.com/dallin_stagg/status/1707867742097862786#m,"Another great podcast episode from @sterlingmsnow and @thogge, I highly recommend you listen.  Biggest takeaways for me were the following: 1️⃣ - Because founders raise capital and are the leaders of the startup, they’re expected to be the most optimistic about an idea. Simultaneously, they have to be the ones who make the choice to pivot. You must ride the line between being the most optimistic and also quickest to admit that the company is moving in the wrong direction. 2️⃣ - Product market fit can be difficult to pinpoint because many times, people you ask are too nice to tell the king he’s not wearing clothes. Genuine feedback can be rare, especially before they’re paying for the service and have skin in the game. @sterlingmsnow shared an insightful quote (paraphrasing): “If someone says something you want to hear, be skeptical. If someone says something you don’t want to hear, pay attention.”  Thanks for the knowledge you shared, @garrytan.

https://twitter.com/moshe3t/status/1707825033026875666#m,"I have advised over 100 FAILED startups and over a dozen successful ones,   All failed startup founders have in common is their obsession with their idea, premium features, market size, news clippings, trends, and many other romanticized vanity figures.    The common denominator of the successful ones is they're all laser-focused on a theorized principle of a problem or current state that can be changed, and they constantly validate their ever-evolving theories with real potentially paying users and only build what's minimally required to get paid.   It is comical when I start a conversation with a founder; if they begin romanticizing ideas or vanity numbers, I'm like, how far in the abis are you? What did you do? Do you have any proof? The response is always some vanity figure and news clippings.   And funny enough, the successful ones will only build for a group of users (or a single high-paying), what's needed and only when needed, and the failures will have already developed and wasted thousands of dollars (in some cases over $1M) on products that no one wants.  I have one advice to all these founders: start selling to users and stop everything else.   One of the questions I get is, how can I sell before I have a product? To that, I ask, how can you build without knowing if a person is willing to pay for it?  The ones I love to work with are the ones trying to speed up the process of validation, fail fast, have a curious mind, have theories and prove/disprove them, find principles, and understand the problem they're trying to solve while delivering a solution to a single user at a time.

Even if we are well funded with bigger team, the approach to validate a new idea stays similar to #indiehackers; or at least it should be the same.  👉 Here is a simple tip for anyone building Generative AI; or heck any product  When it is a new idea/service, the only thing that matters is   ""Is this a service that solves a painful problem?""  In the execution, the most important question you should be asking is   ""What is the leanest but surest way to validate this?""  By nature, your Generative AI service (or any service) will not be as good as the expert's manually curated / created work.  Examples • AI photoshoot -> Human photoshopped • AI Marketing -> Marketing experts • Translations, Content Suggestions, Tutoring and so on. All the same.  Most of the times, an expert's curated service beats any software.   So, offer a service and be the person to manually do the work for them for the best quality of service.   It may result in delayed time, but often that is a better trade-off than degraded quality of value returned.  If your best quality of service doesn't 'Wow' them and keep them as your customers, your productized software will not work.  You first have to validate if there is demand.  Tech helps with scalability and your first concern should not be scalability.  ==  Yes, as $3M ARR+ Series A, we are launching a new service with manual human labour behind the scenes to test our MVP to validate the demand.  If more advanced and better funded companies are doing so, what is holding you back from being lean and scrappy?","Sep 29, 2023 · 9:35 AM UTC",9,3

While he was intrigued, the most valuable takeaway came indirectly. He mentioned to the friend who set up our meeting that my unkempt nails could use some attention. Despite being a bootstrapped founder,  a $15 manicure would have gone a long way. The subtext? If you can’t manage the small stuff, how can you manage a large enterprise? Today, I’m lucky to call Marshall a trusted friend and mentor. It underscores the point: the little things aren’t so little—they’re a testament to your commitment and attention to detail.

What eventually started as a virtual office solution drifted into events.  And became a $4M SaaS startup.  All before the pandemic struck us in 2020.  Here’s what happened—-  I’ve been doing remote work for 12 years. It was kinda a fringe movement back in 2018. I had my own remote team and we just called it outsourcing back then.  But, I realized that we needed a team that works collaboratively so I created a Virtual office solution replicating that feeling which said like “Hey, I’m working next to you.” or “How can I help you or let’s collaborate.”  In short, maintain that HUMAN connection.  I ended up partnering with “@VirtualSummits” and it was boring. Just pre-recorded videos.  I talked to the founder “Why can’t we make it like this?” Then, went on to sponsor the event.  Modified my product into a virtual event product and tried to sell them via first-hand experience.  3 days. 10k people.  I asked them “You experienced Remo. You wanna take this to the virtual office?”  They responded with, “Office? I want this for virtual events!”  From that point, I started to pivot and then rebuilt a BIG piece of my product—- office to event focused.  Then, started selling in 2020 literally right before the pandemic.  How did you blend your virtual working co-spaces in the covid?","Sep 28, 2023 · 3:11 PM UTC",8,4

From my experience, 70% of startups succeed who did this before development. Vision is not yet a business model or a plan, but it allows you and your team to be on the same page and understand the project's direction.  Usually, by Vision, people understand a short statement, like this famous one by Google ""To provide access to the world's information in one click"", or Tesla ""To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"".  But it's not only that. I offer all my clients to answer these 12 questions, which usually change their business perspective. You can take screenshots.
