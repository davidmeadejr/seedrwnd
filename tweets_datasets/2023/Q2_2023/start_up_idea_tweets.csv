Though investing in Nykaa at its IPO valuation may not have been a great idea, the company has an interesting business model.  According to a report, in 2022, there are 115 million upper-middle class households. This number will rise to 168 million in 2023. On top of that beauty and personal care (BPC) is one of the fastest-growing categories. With higher disposable income the market will go towards premiumization. Nykaa Fashion has captured a 16% share of the premium online fashion market in FY2023.  With Nykaa's focus on semi-served tier-2+ cities from where 84% of its business comes, the company is poised to gain scale. The company is also focusing to scale up its eB2B business. So will Nykaa be able to achieve rapid growth in the next few years and improve its paper-thin profit margins?

The VP of people and culture at the Washington-based healthcare start-up recently gave her perspective to HR Brew and had some really interesting ideas.  Jennifer approaches HR from a ""humanistic perspective."" She has a counseling background, and when people interact with her, she aims to make sure ""they feel seen and heard.""  Her overall philosophy is: ""I want work to feel like a place where you can be safe, and you can pay your rent, and you can do amazing things.""  Bingaman is working to build a culture that allows colleagues to do meaningful work that also moves the business forward.  One of the biggest changes she's made at MCG is about policy.  She says: ""Very rarely does a policy actually solve a problem. I could create a bunch of policies, but if I don't have the culture to support the things I'm trying to get after, then there's no point in having a policy. Instead, what I try to do is create cultural norms and expectations around how we engage with each other.""  Bravo, Jennifer! I really love your refreshing perspective on this.

https://twitter.com/uper_max/status/1659212197548154880#m,"Yo, let me introduce myself 🤝   I'm Max, the founder of @intropia. I've spent a wild decade-plus in the realms of growth and crypto.  The crypto bug bit me by chance while I was hunting for someone to code a non-national currency for a start-up I was building in 2013 (no idea how I even came up with that idea).   I read the Bitcoin white paper, went down the rabbit hole, scribbled my first crypto paper in 2014, and even hit up the inaugural crypto conference that year.  In 2016, I was a university graduate with a diploma thesis on cryptocurrency. Despite receiving an offer from a government-backed organization to tutor old-school entrepreneurs on crypto, I decided to follow a different path. Just a few short months later, I stepped into the role of CMO at my first crypto startup.  Post-launch, I parted ways and co-founded Byzantium, a crypto marketing firm. We had a crazy ride, racking up 150 mil+ for our clients in half a year. Mid-2018, I bounced for a year-long sabbatical, returning in 2019 to launch ""Make it in Ukraine"", an offshore talent recruitment platform. Thanks to Covid, our venture has skyrocketed.   Fast-forward to 2020, DeFi summer hit, and we found ourselves neck-deep in web3 recruitment. The demand for web3-native talent was staggering. I saw how web3 was reshaping our careers and organizations, and the rise of on-chain identities.  That's when the idea of @intropia clicked. I wanted to empower the new wave of workers and organizations through a positive-sum professional network.   Intropia thrives on on-chain reputation and introductions while aligning incentives for users – be they professionals, organizations, or communities.  When I'm not stirring the crypto pot, I'm probably cooking a real one, devouring books, musing over existential dilemmas, or just marveling at the beauty of every passing moment.  ✌️","May 18, 2023 · 2:59 PM UTC",19,6
