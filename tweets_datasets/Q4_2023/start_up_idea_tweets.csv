En Actiage tenemos muchos (¡muchisimos! no hemos dejado de testar cosas) de los primeros y unos pocos de los segundos…  De este último grupo, destaca que desde el principio entendimos que una de las claves del éxito pasaría por crear productos y servicios excepcionalmente buenos y totalmente diferentes a lo que hacen otras empresas.  Al fin y al cabo, si tienes recursos limitados no parece buena idea ofrecer lo mismo que todo el mundo, aunque esto suponga explorar nuevos caminos y enfrentarse a mayores niveles de incertidumbre (y no pocas veces, de incomprensión).  Así, priorizamos nuestros recursos en la diferenciación, concibiendo productos y servicios desde la necesidad de nuestros usuarios y no guiándonos por lo que hacen otros agentes del mercado.  Como resultado, el boca-oreja ha sido el principal motor de nuestro crecimiento, muy por delante de cualquier fuente.  Porque prácticamente toda persona que ha probado uno de nuestros tratamientos o suplementos nutricionales, nos recomienda. Y, con cada recomendación, empieza nuevamente el ciclo.  Tenemos muchísimas anécdotas en este sentido. Recomendaciones entre amigos, hijos que compran para sus padres, personas que compran para otras que por las razones que sean no pueden hacerlo por sí mismas, compradores en el extranjero….  Pero algunas personas no sólo nos recomiendan sino que también se convierten en auténticos fans que empiezan a “conversar” contigo sobre una pasión y una visión común, que en nuestro caso no es otro que el de disfrutar de mayores niveles de salud a largo plazo.  Conversaciones que a lo largo del tiempo se transforman en una relación más profunda donde te das cuenta lo mucho que se tiene en común y cómo juntos se puede impactar de una mejor manera en este mundo.  Y esto es lo que nos pasó con Patricia… y no podemos estar más felices de que se nos haya unido para que más personas disfruten de una longevidad más larga y saludable.","Dec 1, 2023 · 8:14 AM UTC",1,0

Elon Musk's start-up Neuralink aims to install brain chips in up to 11 people in 2024, with thousands of volunteers having lined up to take part.  Research by Foresight Factory suggests that more than a third of consumers (35%) would be willing to have such a chip implanted, in order to connect directly to computer systems. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently gave Neuralink approval to begin human trials, after initially refusing it.  Neuralink, which launched in 2016, is centred on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, and has already implanted chips successfully in mice, pigs and monkeys.  The startup is working on flexible threads, far thinner than human hair, designed to be implanted into the brain by a large robot to 'read' brain activity. Courtesy : Yahoo!

https://twitter.com/shivanshi_v/status/1725145102102966411#m,"I did my first startup right after entering to IIT Ropar. It was based on hyper-local delivery model. I thought  I would build something out of college, drop out and maybe apply for the Thiel Fellowship :)  But only if start-up journey were so certain and predictable. That idea eventually failed. Actually, we failed at the execution part to be really honest.   But I tasted the thrill of building a company and we couldn't wait but  start another one in healthcare domain.  And we served thousands of users, we raised angel and pre-seed  funding while being in college and still building @HealthTick  with the same enthusiasms.  It was named Yoboshu Cares in the start.  Well, if anyone here building out of college, here's my top-3 learnings.   - Startups take huge amount of time and energy, make sure you can manage with your academic.(Until and unless you are certain to drop out)  -Your grades and social life will almost certainly suffer. (I know the pain to manage a decent grade while still working on Yoboshu Cares. I litterly went on ZERO trips during my college)  - Success in startups is very difficult to achieve unlike academic achievement. If you are the person who chase instant gratification, stay away from this game. Delayed gratification is the key.","Nov 16, 2023 · 1:33 PM UTC",74,3

Don't train one until you've proven product market fit.  The beauty of the flourishing A.I. API ecosystem is you can get to market with your product very quickly. You should use an existing API to get an MVP out the door as quickly as possible.   When your idea gains some traction, start collecting data. Figure out how to best structure it and start vacuuming up as much as you can.  When you start to meaningfully scale with proven PMF along with a large dataset, then we will talk about training a model.   ...and odds are, no, you won't need to pay OpenAI $2-3m to get a model trained. There is almost certainly a smaller open source model that you can train to be an expert in your use-case.  Now get back to shipping!","Nov 9, 2023 · 6:41 PM UTC",2,0

https://twitter.com/litwinowski/status/1721611823210721320#m,"A friend recently reached out asking how to start with his own start-up 🤔  There are many ways to do that, but let me share just 2 that worked for me with Leyr.  🚀 If you have an idea and are looking for a team, or even if you don't have an idea, but have skills - go for start-up accelerator, like Antler. They have so many locations these days: https://www.antler.co/location. And if you don't want Antler - google for ""startup accelerators"" and pick the one you like.  What you'll need: ✅ Some sort of an interview, evaluating yourself (and idea, if you have it) ✅ Means to sustain yourself through the program.  ℹ Investments from accelerators are typically not the biggest ones, but they are investing in ""idea on a napkin"" and most important - help you to find your co-founders.  ⏩ If you want to skip and go for funding directly - look for an early-stage VC or angel investors. Again, simple Google query like ""list of vc funds per industry"" will give you a link like that one: https://openvc.app/blog/vc-list, where you will see a spreadsheet like that: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRdFZhXLqat04xe7qO-p48wXQ00GWJyrzgHSb3YVIp0/edit?pli=1#gid=0  And then it's just reaching out to those you like or as many as you can persevere. Yep, that's what I also did, I swear!  What you'll need: ✅ A pitch-deck with about 10 slides or less, including: problem, solution, market analysis, plans for 6-12-18 months, business model, team (or yourself), competitors, your ask and where those funds will take you ✅ Your own charisma to stand behind the idea  I know it's really difficult, as otherwise everyone would be doing it, but many would be surprised, how actually simple it is 😄  Go for it! 💪","Nov 6, 2023 · 7:33 PM UTC",0,0

The professor had a track record of helping so many students successfully start-up their enterprise and had won national awards for doing so. I brought up what I thought was a wonderful idea at the time (trading forex for people in exchange for some commissions on the profit) to her. And in a few sentences, she let me know how dumb my plan was. She was nice about it but the truth is that a dumb idea is a dumb idea.  I gave her examples of people who were doing it then and offered a full-throttled defense of my business plan. She smiled, shook her head in a motherly way, and said “well, you asked for my opinion, didn’t you?” I left her office, tossed my plan in the trash bin and it was one of the best financial, time management and mental health decisions I made in grad school. Within months, those I thought were successful turned out to be Ponzi schemes. All of them failed, leaving financial, reputational and relationship ruin in their wake. The reasons she told me (which I have omitted for sake of brevity) have been validated time and again.  This post is not about Ponzi schemes, it’s not even about business plans. It’s about the fact that when you respect someone enough to ask for their opinion, and they are gracious enough to give it to you, take it. They know more than you. They have seen more than you. Trust what you see in them not what you think the right answer is.","Nov 4, 2023 · 6:38 PM UTC",810,21

https://twitter.com/david_seroy/status/1710882528809357355#m,"Saturday night musings.   Here's a free #Bitcoin start-up/business idea, with details, on how to create a vastly improved @hodlwithLedn and @unchainedcom. To be clear, I immensely respect these companies, but they leave much to be desired and it annoys me something better doesn't exist. This is low hanging fruit IMO.  Everyone knows Bitcoin backed borrowing has gargantuan PMF (why sell when you can borrow against BTC), but the above companies are expensive as F*** and have major limitations because they're built on legacy fiat rails.  However, recently #Bitcoin backed borrowing models using smart contracts on Bitcoin side-chains like @SovrynBTC and @fuji_money are 10X improvements primarily because you can borrow bitcoin-backed Stablecoins at 0% interest, in perpetuity, with way better LTV and liquidation terms than centralized solutions (See: https://wiki.sovryn.com/en/sovryn-dapp/subprotocols/zero-zusd).   Unfortunately, no one cares nor uses these protocols for a couple of reasons, which I detail below. If you alleviate these issues: 1. regulatory/tax, 2. custody, 3. off-ramping to fiat, you create a pretty clean and potentially very profitable business.  To be clear, the business is building a centralized company on-top of these decentralized protocols, but fixing the barriers to entry, which will lubricate mass adoption and profitability.  Step 1 -- Legal & Tax: Customers need to have comfort they're not doing anything illegal, and operating with 'DeFi' protocols can be kind of sketch. You need to get letters from credible attorney's and CPA's that can reasonably justify that: 1) Swapping to BTC on a sidechain does not trigger a taxable sale.  2) Borrowing against BTC via protocols is not taxable.   Realistically, both of these are grey areas, so take a similar approach to Unchained and have a page with letters that say look there's no clear answer, but here's our due diligence from credible people and their opinions: https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-loans-and-taxes/. You'd also need to consult attorney about potential money transmitter license, KYC, and other applicable licenses that may be needed, probably just NMLS. No major barriers afaict.  Step 2 -- Custody: Find a legit custody provider who would support Bitcoin and the sidechain which the DeFi protocols live on (RSK or Liquid). Maybe @TheyaBitcoin, maybe @CasaHODL maybe @cryptoAPI, maybe @Swan Vault. You definitely don't want to build this solution or take this responsibility. Trust the bigger players. @PeteThePlanner who else can be recommended?  Step 3 -- Build app with simple back-end. Literally only 3 things:  1)  Holds #BTC in cold-storage on-chain.   2) Holds wrapped #BTC on the side-chain for when it's pledged as collateral in the smart contract. 3) Holds stablecoins.   Fortunately. all of this in can be out-sourced using pre-existing API's and infrastructure from the custody solution in Step 2 (assuming you have a strong provider) and then the SDK's from the DeFi apps on the side-chains to integrate with the smart contracts  Step 4 -- Raise an investment fund. This is probably the most unique but potentially the most profitable part. The primary down-fall of these DeFi BTC borrow protocols is when you borrow, you get a new stablecoin instead of popular ones like USDC or USDT. And then people say OK great I borrowed this stablecoin at 0% interest, now WTF do I do with this. They of course want to swap it for more popular fiat backed stables that can be bridged out. So, until and unless the new stablecoin gains adoption you need a corresponding party to bring traditional dollar liquidity that is willing to swap and facilitate the bridge out. Because there is so much demand to make these swaps it can be quite profitable to facilitate the trade. For example a user often times is willing to pay a 1-3% fee just to get USDT from the BTC stablecoin (this can be seen as an implied interest rate or cost to the borrow, despite the actual borrowing being 0% interest). Ultimately, the purpose of the fund is to use dollars raised to facilitate the swap of $1 of fiat backed stablecoins for a premium of the BTC stables. The fund can sit in Treasuries or a MMF, then deploy the dollars as swaps for the BTC stablecoins and collect easy profit.  Further, the next question is wtf does the fund do with these BTC stables? And fortunately, they do have other use cases. Primarily they are used to perform liquidations on BTC loans that go bad. For example, if BTC price drops and $1M loan goes bad, then $1M of the BTC stables from a liquidation pool are burned and in return the liquidation pool receives $1.1M of the BTC that was put up as collateral. This can be very lucrative during times of distress as funds can be recycled and collect many liquidations. Back-testing estimates show anywhere from 12%-120% APY with average coming in around 35% APY.  To recap, you raise money in a fund using a Reg D SEC structure (consult a securities attorney, obviously). Sit on treasuries, swap the fiat dollars for BTC dollars as needed and collect margin, sit those BTC dollars in the liquidation pool, wait for price volatility, collect the spread on the liquidations, realize the gains immediately (or just sit on BTC) and pay-out your very happy investors. @DAAF17 would you guys place capital in something like this?  Step 5 -- Charge a small premium for your services. Specifically, while the protocol charges 0% interest, you could charge a few hundred bips of interest or a few points on origination on-top for the services and UX. In aggregate, from soup to nuts there are several costs to consider here and it wouldn't technically be 0% interest loans, but even still there appears to be so much room that a significant fraction below the cost of competitors is easily attainable.  Step 6 - Run a profitable company or sell to a big player. Natively on-chain financial services on BTC are going to be a huge thing into the future. I already know for a fact, other large players are trying to get into this space. But they're too busy or don't know how to build this out themselves. Which is why I am publishing this here.   Other notes: - This business could exist right now and Day 1 be making profit. The tech currently exists and is in production. - Very, low over-head business. - Primary risks are of course smart contract and *quasi* decentralization related. However, there is good reason to believe these contracts are quite battle-tested.  --  If you're a legit full-stack developer and want to co-found. I can be convinced @Martellfox know anyone? Otherwise, I hope someone else takes it, steals my idea and does it themselves. The community deserves these products.  For context, the prior venture I founded and sold was an asset backed lending company. There are a lot of parallels I see.  Where does this idea fail and who is going to build it?","Oct 8, 2023 · 4:59 AM UTC",34,13
