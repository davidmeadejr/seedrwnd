The best resource I've found on this topic is @paulg's essay How To Get Startup Ideas.  The crux of his advice is to turn your brain into the type that has startup ideas unconsciously by:  1. Learning a lot about things that matter  2. Working on problems that interest you  3. With people you like and respect (this is incidentally how you get co-founders at the same time as the idea)  In other words, learn powerful things, follow your intellectual curiosity, and work on things that stretch you. What really matters for coming up with good startup ideas is domain expertise.

https://twitter.com/MaxPrilutskiy/status/1674431843939291136#m,"Today, I added the 1001st entry to my list of potential startup ideas.  It may seem like I'm running a creative marathon here, but the secret sauce is pretty simple:  every idea that pops into my mind, no matter how silly it seems goes straight to a dedicated @NotionHQ page.  At first, you might imagine me scribbling down weird concepts like 'delivery service for dogs' or 'recycling program for teabags'.  Yes, those exist in my list.  But as I continued to write, I noticed something very interesting.  Picture this:   it's like clearing out a messy room. Initially, you toss out a bunch of useless stuff. But as the room gets cleaner, you start to find some useful items. Similarly, the first few ideas are the obvious, overdone ones. But as you keep pushing, you start to uncover the unique ones.  Once you start, it's hard to stop. The ideas keep coming, each one better than the last. You're like an idea machine, documenting each brainwave in your notes app.  Not all ideas are going to be great. That's true. Some are annoying, others have potential. And then there are those that are so good, you can't believe you thought of them.  What I learned, is that the more ideas I let out, the more room I make for new ones. The more I write down, the more ideas pop up. That was somewhat unobvious to me.  @paulg once said, in one of his essays, that the best way to have startup ideas is to become the sort of person who generates them.  And now, I believe, I understand the actual meaning behind these words.","Jun 29, 2023 · 2:57 PM UTC",5,2

Most of them aren't coming back - and you just have speculators (who have no idea what's going on on the ground) just talking amongst each other, now.
