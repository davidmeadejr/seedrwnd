The idea of crowdsourcing proprietary data through incentivized partnerships is an old trick that has worked well in the past and could be a game-changer for new AI startups. By leveraging the power of community and mutual benefit, startups can access valuable data and insights while providing value to their partners. It's exciting to see new approaches to solving the challenges of data access and acquisition in the AI space, and I look forward to seeing how this model evolves and shapes the future of AI startups.  #AI #startups #dataacquisition #crowdsourcing #innovation #communitybuilding","Mar 30, 2023 · 2:44 PM UTC",0,0

Do you think of various projects, startups, problem solvers, and all you want to do is execute on these? All your ideas are 10/10 and amazing, and you're sure that they'll be amazing businesses?   I would say I fall into this boat. I am an extremely creative person, with many thoughts. Everyday I'll think of a new idea, whether it's something completely unheard of, maybe something that adds onto a current business, maybe it's something that is in a niche I've never even touched. My head is extremely clouded in these ideas, and I'm left with the decision of what to do with these ideas. A constant battle of ""is it worth my time?""   As I begin to learn more and more, in life and business alike. There's one thing that I've skipped out on for too long: focusing on one venture. Trying to figure out how to make 5 different businesses succeed at one time is simply just not possible (at least for me). Dialing down on one focus is almost indispensable at this point in my life. I've pushed this off for far too long, and now is the time to take action. Struggle is foreordained, but failure is not certain. The power of your work, when focused in one will be so incredibly powerful and your output will show for it.   Do you struggle with this as well?

https://twitter.com/mattwatsonkc/status/1641067614091763712#m,"You have a startup and can't afford a developer. What do you do? You have 7 options. (but really 2)  I posted the other day about how hiring ONLY entry level developers is a really bad idea for startups.  It went viral and got hundreds of thousands of views! 👀  A common question was what do I do if I can only afford an entry level person or no developer at all?  Let's review your options:  1. You could learn to code yourself  2. Use no-code or low-code solutions  3. Find a technical co-founder  4. Find a part time freelancer  5. Join an accelerator or incubator  6. Raise more capital  7. Hire offshore developers  I know people who have done all these options and they all work!  Once upon a time I was that technical co-founder helping out another entrepreneur who had the idea.  We knocked it out of the park 8 years later for a big exit.  My warning though... if you are starting a tech company and you know nothing about tech... 😬  The dangerous part as a non tech founder is you can easily be taken advantage of by developers, freelancers, dev agencies and others because you know nothing about tech.  🚩 Be very careful hiring any vendors you don't trust!!  Use someone you know or can get a very strong referral for.  💡 Ultimately, you either need to find a co-founder to write code or you better be ready to write checks.  Low code and no code solutions could potentially help you at least validate a product idea... but it likely won't work for your final product.  So, are you writing code or checks??? 🤔  #founders #startups #techcofounders #hiring #developers","Mar 29, 2023 · 1:19 PM UTC",0,0
