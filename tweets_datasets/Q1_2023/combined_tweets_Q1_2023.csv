The idea of crowdsourcing proprietary data through incentivized partnerships is an old trick that has worked well in the past and could be a game-changer for new AI startups. By leveraging the power of community and mutual benefit, startups can access valuable data and insights while providing value to their partners. It's exciting to see new approaches to solving the challenges of data access and acquisition in the AI space, and I look forward to seeing how this model evolves and shapes the future of AI startups.  #AI #startups #dataacquisition #crowdsourcing #innovation #communitybuilding","Mar 30, 2023 · 2:44 PM UTC",0,0

Do you think of various projects, startups, problem solvers, and all you want to do is execute on these? All your ideas are 10/10 and amazing, and you're sure that they'll be amazing businesses?   I would say I fall into this boat. I am an extremely creative person, with many thoughts. Everyday I'll think of a new idea, whether it's something completely unheard of, maybe something that adds onto a current business, maybe it's something that is in a niche I've never even touched. My head is extremely clouded in these ideas, and I'm left with the decision of what to do with these ideas. A constant battle of ""is it worth my time?""   As I begin to learn more and more, in life and business alike. There's one thing that I've skipped out on for too long: focusing on one venture. Trying to figure out how to make 5 different businesses succeed at one time is simply just not possible (at least for me). Dialing down on one focus is almost indispensable at this point in my life. I've pushed this off for far too long, and now is the time to take action. Struggle is foreordained, but failure is not certain. The power of your work, when focused in one will be so incredibly powerful and your output will show for it.   Do you struggle with this as well?

https://twitter.com/mattwatsonkc/status/1641067614091763712#m,"You have a startup and can't afford a developer. What do you do? You have 7 options. (but really 2)  I posted the other day about how hiring ONLY entry level developers is a really bad idea for startups.  It went viral and got hundreds of thousands of views! 👀  A common question was what do I do if I can only afford an entry level person or no developer at all?  Let's review your options:  1. You could learn to code yourself  2. Use no-code or low-code solutions  3. Find a technical co-founder  4. Find a part time freelancer  5. Join an accelerator or incubator  6. Raise more capital  7. Hire offshore developers  I know people who have done all these options and they all work!  Once upon a time I was that technical co-founder helping out another entrepreneur who had the idea.  We knocked it out of the park 8 years later for a big exit.  My warning though... if you are starting a tech company and you know nothing about tech... 😬  The dangerous part as a non tech founder is you can easily be taken advantage of by developers, freelancers, dev agencies and others because you know nothing about tech.  🚩 Be very careful hiring any vendors you don't trust!!  Use someone you know or can get a very strong referral for.  💡 Ultimately, you either need to find a co-founder to write code or you better be ready to write checks.  Low code and no code solutions could potentially help you at least validate a product idea... but it likely won't work for your final product.  So, are you writing code or checks??? 🤔  #founders #startups #techcofounders #hiring #developers","Mar 29, 2023 · 1:19 PM UTC",0,0

This is a great progress for our Pi Community.  As per this information, there probably will have a project to coordinate these businesses ambassador! @PiCoreTeam #WhatIDoForPi #piGCV  Become a Local Business Ambassador  Already, many local shops and small businesses in many parts of the world are accepting Pi as a form of payments for real goods and services. The diversity of people, geographies, and goods and services Pi transactions represent is a beautiful tapestry worthy of a proud network. Local businesses are an important component to the Pi ecosystem and will make great contributions to building substance and utilities for the network. Local businesses are also where the grassroots power of the Pi community can be unleashed to have great potential and impact—something rarely seen in other networks. We know that many Pioneers are shop and small business owners themselves while many other Pioneers living in their local environments have abundant access to and ability to convince local small businesses to integrate Pi. Thus, we are thinking about forming a program for Pioneers to onboard local businesses into the Pi ecosystem. However, we recognize some challenges in this endeavor, such as the large offline portions of local business activities, logistics and accountability etc. Thus, we are open to community proposals and ideas in the formation phase on how the program can be designed to encourage local businesses integration to Pi while resolving the challenges. If you are knowledgeable about local businesses or enthusiastic about this direction of ecosystem building, submit your ideas via Pi support portal. Stay tuned for more updates on this program. To submit an idea: Navigate minepi.com/support and enter the Support Portal. Under the box “Need to raise a request? Contact us”, scroll down to select the option called “Community Proposals/Feature Requests” and then complete the form. For the question “What is your request”, please select the “Local Business Ambassador Program” option. Using this format correctly will ensure that the Core Team is able to identify and review your message.","Mar 30, 2023 · 4:35 PM UTC",637,20

https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1641456248905256962#m,"I present a 2,000-character business plan.   The purpose? To have my business idea tested in public & have fun   Let's do it...  The idea: A text-based content agency for Founders/CEOs/execs. You run your business, we run your mini media company on Twitter/Linkedin.   The Thesis: Execs are waking up to the importance of building an audience on social but they don't have the time or skill to create it.   Why?  1) Building an audience is getting more valuable as the internet becomes noisier & the cost of attention is higher.   2) We've seen the tangible value of founders investing in their brand via text:  @SahilBloom: raised a fund, secured a book deal, and owns several businesses @sweatystartup: got majority of investors for his self-storage business @jspujji: got all of his initial customers for Growth Assistant from a tweet thread  3) There's been emphasis placed on short-form video agencies creating TikTok vids, but I believe text-based platforms have been forgotten.   The opportunity? The value of being a mini media company on Twitter/Linkedin is clear yet founders don't maximize it.  Why?  1) Time. Creating content is looked at as a nice to have, not a need to have. Need to have is running your business, setting your strategy, managing your team.  2) Skills. Even if a founder believes deeply in creating content, they don’t necessarily have the skills. 3) Hard to measure. Even if a founder believes in creating content, they view it as an investment that won’t drive measurable ROI.    The pitch:  - What if you could give founders their time back. AND - What if founders didn’t have to rely on their own skills. AND - What if you could set tangible goals that you can consistently measure your investment against.   An agency that lets founders have the best of both worlds. Building a brand, while building a company.   Idea validation:  Step 1: put out tweet about this hypothetical business & see who DMs me Step 2: pick 1-2 people as test clients & set up the process to service their needs. Step 3: source quality writer for them Step 4: monitor performance on weekly basis and make tweaks Step 5: build process & scale model once success proven  Anticipated challenges:  1) Proving ROI & getting clients early wins so they trust the process as content is a long game 2) Finding great writers that can understand technical knowledge, hone voice, and are affordable","Mar 30, 2023 · 3:04 PM UTC",151,60
