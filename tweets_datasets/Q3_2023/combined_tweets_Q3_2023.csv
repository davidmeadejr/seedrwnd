https://twitter.com/dallin_stagg/status/1707867742097862786#m,"Another great podcast episode from @sterlingmsnow and @thogge, I highly recommend you listen.  Biggest takeaways for me were the following: 1️⃣ - Because founders raise capital and are the leaders of the startup, they’re expected to be the most optimistic about an idea. Simultaneously, they have to be the ones who make the choice to pivot. You must ride the line between being the most optimistic and also quickest to admit that the company is moving in the wrong direction. 2️⃣ - Product market fit can be difficult to pinpoint because many times, people you ask are too nice to tell the king he’s not wearing clothes. Genuine feedback can be rare, especially before they’re paying for the service and have skin in the game. @sterlingmsnow shared an insightful quote (paraphrasing): “If someone says something you want to hear, be skeptical. If someone says something you don’t want to hear, pay attention.”  Thanks for the knowledge you shared, @garrytan.

https://twitter.com/moshe3t/status/1707825033026875666#m,"I have advised over 100 FAILED startups and over a dozen successful ones,   All failed startup founders have in common is their obsession with their idea, premium features, market size, news clippings, trends, and many other romanticized vanity figures.    The common denominator of the successful ones is they're all laser-focused on a theorized principle of a problem or current state that can be changed, and they constantly validate their ever-evolving theories with real potentially paying users and only build what's minimally required to get paid.   It is comical when I start a conversation with a founder; if they begin romanticizing ideas or vanity numbers, I'm like, how far in the abis are you? What did you do? Do you have any proof? The response is always some vanity figure and news clippings.   And funny enough, the successful ones will only build for a group of users (or a single high-paying), what's needed and only when needed, and the failures will have already developed and wasted thousands of dollars (in some cases over $1M) on products that no one wants.  I have one advice to all these founders: start selling to users and stop everything else.   One of the questions I get is, how can I sell before I have a product? To that, I ask, how can you build without knowing if a person is willing to pay for it?  The ones I love to work with are the ones trying to speed up the process of validation, fail fast, have a curious mind, have theories and prove/disprove them, find principles, and understand the problem they're trying to solve while delivering a solution to a single user at a time.

Even if we are well funded with bigger team, the approach to validate a new idea stays similar to #indiehackers; or at least it should be the same.  👉 Here is a simple tip for anyone building Generative AI; or heck any product  When it is a new idea/service, the only thing that matters is   ""Is this a service that solves a painful problem?""  In the execution, the most important question you should be asking is   ""What is the leanest but surest way to validate this?""  By nature, your Generative AI service (or any service) will not be as good as the expert's manually curated / created work.  Examples • AI photoshoot -> Human photoshopped • AI Marketing -> Marketing experts • Translations, Content Suggestions, Tutoring and so on. All the same.  Most of the times, an expert's curated service beats any software.   So, offer a service and be the person to manually do the work for them for the best quality of service.   It may result in delayed time, but often that is a better trade-off than degraded quality of value returned.  If your best quality of service doesn't 'Wow' them and keep them as your customers, your productized software will not work.  You first have to validate if there is demand.  Tech helps with scalability and your first concern should not be scalability.  ==  Yes, as $3M ARR+ Series A, we are launching a new service with manual human labour behind the scenes to test our MVP to validate the demand.  If more advanced and better funded companies are doing so, what is holding you back from being lean and scrappy?","Sep 29, 2023 · 9:35 AM UTC",9,3

While he was intrigued, the most valuable takeaway came indirectly. He mentioned to the friend who set up our meeting that my unkempt nails could use some attention. Despite being a bootstrapped founder,  a $15 manicure would have gone a long way. The subtext? If you can’t manage the small stuff, how can you manage a large enterprise? Today, I’m lucky to call Marshall a trusted friend and mentor. It underscores the point: the little things aren’t so little—they’re a testament to your commitment and attention to detail.

What eventually started as a virtual office solution drifted into events.  And became a $4M SaaS startup.  All before the pandemic struck us in 2020.  Here’s what happened—-  I’ve been doing remote work for 12 years. It was kinda a fringe movement back in 2018. I had my own remote team and we just called it outsourcing back then.  But, I realized that we needed a team that works collaboratively so I created a Virtual office solution replicating that feeling which said like “Hey, I’m working next to you.” or “How can I help you or let’s collaborate.”  In short, maintain that HUMAN connection.  I ended up partnering with “@VirtualSummits” and it was boring. Just pre-recorded videos.  I talked to the founder “Why can’t we make it like this?” Then, went on to sponsor the event.  Modified my product into a virtual event product and tried to sell them via first-hand experience.  3 days. 10k people.  I asked them “You experienced Remo. You wanna take this to the virtual office?”  They responded with, “Office? I want this for virtual events!”  From that point, I started to pivot and then rebuilt a BIG piece of my product—- office to event focused.  Then, started selling in 2020 literally right before the pandemic.  How did you blend your virtual working co-spaces in the covid?","Sep 28, 2023 · 3:11 PM UTC",8,4

From my experience, 70% of startups succeed who did this before development. Vision is not yet a business model or a plan, but it allows you and your team to be on the same page and understand the project's direction.  Usually, by Vision, people understand a short statement, like this famous one by Google ""To provide access to the world's information in one click"", or Tesla ""To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"".  But it's not only that. I offer all my clients to answer these 12 questions, which usually change their business perspective. You can take screenshots.

Just figure out if you can move that into a SaaS app…”  Enter @TryAssemble.  This morning, I met @EEsclusa, Co-Founder + Co-CEO of Assemble who walked me through the product which helps companies “make better compensation decisions” and in doing so, create a high-performance team culture.  The way companies have had to use spreadsheets to “manage” this process which can be overwhelming, ineffective etc at times, reminded me of exactly what David Sacks described.  A phenomenal challenge / opportunity space to build a business.

Simple things look like an uphill task. Motivation is at an all-time low:  We all face ups and downs in our start-up journey.    But why? From my real experience, I could think of possible reasons.    Funding: Running low on funds can really impact a business, especially for committed founders. Competition: Standing out in a competitive business landscape can lead to discouragement among startup founders.  Personal Sacrifices: Starting and growing a business often involves personal sacrifices, leading to stress and burnout.  Setbacks: Despite planning, setbacks are inevitable and can be demoralizing for founders.  Burnout: Demanding startup responsibilities can lead to burnout, affecting motivation and well-being.    What to do: Talk to people you connect with.   Your friends, family, or mentors. Do not be tough on yourself.  You have it in you.   Give yourself a little time.  It is a long-haul game.   Your mental well-being comes first.","Sep 9, 2023 · 12:43 PM UTC",3,1

Here are some examples of using the principles in a business context:  ◇ Know Your Market and Competitors:     • Understand your industry, competitors, and market trends thoroughly.    • Gather intelligence to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis).  ◇ Adaptability and Flexibility:     • Be adaptable and ready to pivot when market conditions change.    • Adjust your business strategies based on emerging trends and customer preferences.  ◇ Sun Tzu's Five Factors:     • Apply the Five Factors (Moral Law, Heaven, Earth, the Commander, and Method and Discipline) to assess your business environment and strategy.  ◇ Know Your Strengths and Weaknesses:     • Conduct an internal analysis to identify your organization's strengths and weaknesses.    • Allocate resources to reinforce strengths and address weaknesses.  ◇ Deception and Misdirection:     • Use marketing and branding to create a perception of strength and quality, even if you are a smaller business.    • Employ tactics that surprise competitors and disrupt their plans.  ◇ Win Without Fighting:     • Seek win-win solutions and partnerships in negotiations.    • Compete through innovation and unique value propositions that make it difficult for competitors to directly challenge you.  ◇ Strategy and Tactics:     • Develop a clear overarching business strategy (e.g., cost leadership, differentiation).    • Implement tactical plans and initiatives that align with your strategy.  ◇ Resource Management:     • Efficiently allocate and manage resources, including finances, personnel, and time.    • Avoid overextension by focusing on key areas of strength and opportunity.  ◇ The Art of Timing:     • Identify the right timing for product launches, marketing campaigns, and market entries.    • Seize opportunities when your competitors are weak or unprepared.  ◇ Leadership and Decision-Making:     • Lead with wisdom, adaptability, and a deep understanding of your team's strengths and weaknesses.    • Make well-informed decisions based on accurate information and analysis.  ◇ Avoid Protracted Conflicts:     • Resolve disputes and conflicts swiftly to prevent long-term damage to relationships or resources.    • Seek peaceful resolutions in negotiations when possible.  ◇ Gather Intelligence on your Competitors:     • Gather competitive intelligence to stay informed about your rivals' strategies, weaknesses, and plans.    • Leverage this information to make informed decisions and anticipate market moves.  ◇ Balance Risk and Reward:     • Assess the risks associated with your business decisions and take calculated risks when the potential rewards justify them.  ◇ Continuous Improvement:     • Implement a culture of continuous improvement to refine your products, services, and processes.    • Strive for excellence in all aspects of your business.  ◇ Winning Hearts and Minds:     • Build strong customer relationships and brand loyalty through exceptional customer service and quality.    • Ensure that your customers become advocates for your business.  By incorporating these principles from ""The Art of War"" into your business strategy, you can enhance your competitive edge, make more informed decisions, and navigate the complexities of the business world more effectively.","Sep 29, 2023 · 11:47 PM UTC",2,0

The business would require equipment such as a hay baler, tractor, rake, and other necessary machinery to efficiently harvest, bale, and store hay.  Budget Allocation: 1. Hay Baler and Equipment: $15,000 2. Second Hand Tractor and Attachments: $6,000 3. Storage Facility/Infrastructure: $2,000 4. Marketing and Promotion: $1,000 5. Miscellaneous Expenses: $1,000  Risks: 1. Weather Conditions: Adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall or drought, can impact hay production and quality, potentially leading to lower yields and financial losses. 2. Market Demand and Competition: The demand for hay may fluctuate due to changes in livestock numbers, feed alternatives, or economic factors. Additionally, competition from existing hay suppliers in the area could affect sales. 3. Equipment Maintenance and Breakdowns: Machinery breakdowns or maintenance issues can disrupt operations and result in additional expenses and downtime. 4. Price Volatility: Hay prices can vary depending on supply and demand factors. Fluctuations in prices may affect profitability. 5. Seasonal Nature of Business: Hay production is seasonal, typically during the growing season. This means generating revenue during other times of the year may be challenging.  Benefits: 1. Revenue Potential: The hay industry can be profitable, especially in areas with a high demand for livestock feed. Selling baled hay can provide a steady income stream. Matebeleland areas.  2. Diversification: The business can provide diversification for farmers or individuals with existing agricultural operations, allowing them to expand their product offerings and income streams. 3. Utilization of Resources: Utilizing available land and resources to grow and sell hay can maximize the productivity and profitability of the agricultural enterprise. 4. Market Stability: The need for hay remains relatively stable, as livestock owners, equestrian centers, and other agricultural businesses rely on it for animal feed. 5. Long-Term Resilience: Building a reputation for producing high-quality hay and establishing strong relationships with customers can lead to long-term business stability and growth.  Risk Mitigation Strategies: 1. Diversify Customer Base: Target a diverse range of customers, to reduce dependence on a single market segment. 2. Monitor Market Trends: Stay informed about market trends, livestock numbers, and feed alternatives to anticipate changes in demand and adjust production accordingly. 3. Implement Maintenance Schedule: Regularly maintain and service equipment to minimize breakdowns and unexpected repairs. Consider investing in backup machinery or establishing relationships with equipment repair services. 4. Develop Storage and Preservation Plan: Properly store and preserve baled hay to maintain quality and prevent spoilage, ensuring a reliable supply for customers. 5. Financial Planning: Maintain a financial cushion to withstand potential market fluctuations and unexpected expenses. Consider diversifying income sources or exploring value-added products like hay pellets or haylage to mitigate risks.","Sep 29, 2023 · 6:51 PM UTC",0,0

I’m not ready to start my own business. I’m not ready to quit this job. I'm not ready to break up with my relationship… Give me another few months. I’ve got to prepare myself.’  I want you to get this idea that you ARE ready. That you have to try and do things BEFORE you think you are ready…  If you think, 'Well, I’m not prepared to start this business. I need to go back to business school. I need to learn more and more,’ SHUT UP AND DO IT.  You will learn MORE by starting before you think you are ready. By making that decision, your brain will kick into action. You will discover all this energy that you had that you didn’t think you had.  So make the decision before you think you’re ready.”","Sep 29, 2023 · 6:01 PM UTC",0,0

As for the glass get the ones with the lids they prevent the scent from fading. Get a heavy glass to avoid breaking when burning  The glass ranges between 80-100 or get the alcohol glass for 2 bob each and take to glass cutters they do it with 15-30 bob  As for the wick you can get them either from the shops that sell candles or check YouTube and make on your own  A little research will help you not to mess with measurements of every ingredient to be used. As for colors you can use dyes or food color or melt the crayon pens. Most people use paraffin wax and soy wax  Pls note its fragrance oil not fragrance perfume, perfume doesn't burn it will clog the wick  To standout in the market bring something that's not common ie creating unique scents and using silicone moulds to make different shapes of candles","Sep 29, 2023 · 3:55 PM UTC",33,0

Also I think Spotify is owned by one of the majors so they probs have an interest in keeping artists dependent on their business.  I had an idea to make a decentralised streaming platform, feel like this would be an interesting use case of Blockchain tech.  It would work like an extension of file coin:  1. Host music on ipfs verify/register ownership of content somehow  2. Pay what you want stream fee; minimum price can be set by artist  3. Users can pick what their rate is per stream can also opt to pay per stream  3. Fee is split between artists org and file host and service fee   4. Get paid in coin for hosting if you can do so reliably offsetting stream costs  User would top up their wallets with the coin, can take payment in fiat.   Coin would not be transferable once minted at a fixed price.  Really hard part is verifying an entity has the rights to the music such that unverified music wouldn't be listed and eligible for stream fee.  Users would interface with through a web app with a player.  Think it would be very important to make the utility front and center and hide the crypto stuff since it's not really relevant how stuff is made but more about why it's made.","Sep 29, 2023 · 7:50 AM UTC",0,0
