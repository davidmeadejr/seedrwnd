https://twitter.com/arestaurant_guy/status/1737176699396112747#m,"What I hope to see from a salesman who is trying to get our business:  1) Come prepared.  Have at least an idea of what our menu is, because pitching Chinese food to a sports bar just doesn't make sense.  2) Don't bash our current supplier.  I use them for a reason.  I trust them more than I trust someone off the street. You don't have any upside with me by doing this.  3) I don't want to be pitched a random item if we haven't met before.  I'm sure you have great meat and I'm sure you have a great IPA. I don't care, everyone does.   Start by asking us about what we're looking for and follow up next week with what we talk about.  4) Don't stop in during peak hours, unless you have reason to believe we're slow.  An unsolicited sales pitch during lunch isn't going to do anything but piss me off, especially if we've never met.  5) If you come in for lunch with a friend & I'm your server, and you've spent the last month trying to get my business, you damn well better leave a tip. I do not care about the $5.  I do care about how you act in a restaurant (and, yes, this actually happened).  6) If I ask for a quote on a dozen items, and you promise me you'll have it done by Friday, then I need it by Friday.  If you flake out on the first agreement we make together, you're going to flake on the rest of our relationship as well.  7) Eventually you're going to have to offer something I can't get with my current suppliers.  They are the incumbent.  The incumbent has a huge advantage.  If I'm even marginally happy with my current supplier, I need to think I have upside with you-because switching from something that works is nothing but downside.  8) Don't talk down to my staff.  I've seen this.  Instant, irreversible turn off.  As I read through all of this, it basically comes down to this: build trust. There's many ways to do this, but there's just as many ways to lose it.

https://twitter.com/sebastianvolkis/status/1736896534501867695#m,"Controversial opinion. Use Bubble to build your SaaS.    Why? Because for every billion dollar idea you have, 10,000 other people had the same idea, and are building it right now.  Are you in this to make money? Build a business? Work for yourself? Become your own boss? Retire? Quit your job?   OR are you in this because you like Javascript?  Whatever your motivation is, he who is first, wins.  No code is a game-changer for rapid market entry and product validation.  Here's the deal: Only code after confirming market demand for your app.  Why this approach? Because, despite what a lot of founders/devs think, saas is just like any other business.   Supply and demand, but this time the supply is the lack of a solution for a problem a lot of people have.  And the competition is a lot more fierce. You're up against the best in the business.  Consider this: Your 'billion-dollar SaaS concept' could take over half a year to develop traditionally. But with Bubble, you're ahead in mere weeks.  And, let's face it, even your great aunt has 3 multi billion dollar app ideas a day, so whats to say yours is any different?  What's your fallback when traditional coding and months of work lead to a dead end?  Passion for coding is great, but it doesn't pay bills.   Customers won't flock to your app because you have the best tech stack.  Yet, with no-code tools, you can carve a niche, outmanoeuvre competitors, and craft a thriving business.  A lot of the time you can get quite far with your bubble MVP, you can monetise it, build a scalable business, and then, once you hit your revenue goals, develop it properly/hire someone.  Too many founders get stuck in the mindset that they need to have everything self coded because ""Bubble reduces exit value"" or ""I don't own my product"".  When in reality, the dude buying your business cares about 2 things:  1) TTM Profit 2) Market size  If they see good numbers in these two things, then your business is worth something.   Maybe slightly lower multiplier if its in no code, but at least you have a product with paying users.   Because while Nathan is googling how to centre a div, you've launched an MVP and are already scooping up market share.  The moral of this is, if you spend 6-12 months building, someone will always get there first.   The person who wins, is the one who gets there first.

https://twitter.com/chasericker3/status/1737201320376057971#m,"I feel that it's quite dishonest how Joel Greenblatt sells small investors the idea that outperformance can be achieved solely through quantitive business factors  Both in this article, and in books such as ""The Little Book that Beats the Market"", etc, he often cites to periods in history where can can do screens for stocks at certain valuations, such as 1972-1978, and his broad claim is that:   ""Because there are periods where stock groups in certain quantitive ranges, ranked off of 1-50 characteristics, outperform other stocks, that makes you capable of picking stock groups solely based off of these quantitive factors in different time periods to outperform""  I find Joel Greenblatt very smartly sells people an incomplete investing philosophy through articles like this, or books with similar philosophy, without ever proving or showing any evidence that outperformance comes from what he's showing. He's just selling the dream that you can go pick 10-30 stocks in certain valuation ranges and outperform  Efficient market theory didn't debunk that you can find individual securities that outperform, but it absolutely debunked the philosophy that Joel Greenblatt is teaching in this article:   The philosophy that you can just buy groups of stocks in certain valuation ranges and show actual outperformance  If you average 2 separate groups of people or 2 groups of stocks based off any amount of identity characteristics, their averaged behavior will be guaranteed to be different in any measured characteristic. This is why you don't want to evaluate groups more than ""I'll look through the things below book value"" and then you're still making your investment decisions completely on individuality and on a combination of qualitative and quantitive factors  You can't do that when you just consider quantitive factors, therefore you can't really complete the process, in the way Warren Buffett would teach investing, to make investing decisions to ever expect to outperform  Joel Greenblatt doesn't attack the right part of efficient market theory, which is to attack the nature of what makes a business a business, through qualitative factors that can't be written down and predicted with algorithms that only see numbers  In summary: I think he way too often teaches the misguided philosophy that there's something to learn from screens through historical valuation ranges without looking at actual business factors such as ""where's the business at and what does that mean"", ""Who runs the business"", etc, etc...","Dec 19, 2023 · 8:00 PM UTC",54,16

Back then, I was broke, £50k in debt, surviving off pot noodles and living behind a railway track on a rough street where heroin addicts used to shoot up on while leaning against my front door, and would quite literally shit on the pavement.  The life I now enjoy is incomparable. I live in a big house by the river with my family and dogs, in an affluent village and do whatever I want whenever I want.  Why am I telling you this?  Because I'm nothing special.   I have no degree, I left school at 16, and had no significant business experience before I started one.  What it actually took to get here was:  - Unwavering self-belief - The willingness to go all in - Being prepared to risk it all - Unending perseverance  These are attributes that anyone can exhibit.   It doesn't matter where you are now...  Your life can change beyond all recognition in a relatively short period of time if you want it badly enough and take the right actions.","Dec 19, 2023 · 6:06 PM UTC",1367,23

But unexpected things have happened as well.  1) I didn't expect that so many people would take it seriously, it was an overwhelming undertaking to respond in detail to 80 different business ideas 😅  2) Out of the handful of people that I picked while being very selective, everyone that I've had a call with so far has that secret sauce. They're motivated, ambitious, organised, creative, and prepared to sacrifice in exchange for success. You don't come across these people normally. If I was looking for someone like this to hire it would be close to impossible, but through this process of elimination it has brought them to the forefront. They also remind me of me when I was first starting out as an extremely hungry young entrepreneur, which brought back a lot of early day memories of suffering and success.  3) I am only investing in one person and being their advisor. However, since I didn't expect to be as impressed by the people as I am, it crossed my mind that even if they don't receive investment from me to become an entrepreneur, I would be very happy to work with them as an intrapreneur within my companies.  To wrap up, I have just a few more calls to make with everyone so far to complete Stage 2 and then once I'm satisfied that I've gotten to know everyone and their ideas well enough, I will pick the ultimate winner.

Today, I’ve made over £30,000,000 revenue with my business.  These 20 lessons will teach you more than a 4-year business degree:  1. There is no get-rich-quick scheme. You need a mixture of hard work, patience and a great idea.  2. Set a large goal and reverse engineer it. Breaking your goals down into bite-sized chunks can make success more achievable in the short and long-term.  3. Trust your gut instinct. If you go against it and it doesn’t work out you will regret it.  4. Get a mentor or coach who has done what you want to do. Make sure you have someone to share experiences, ideas and feedback with.  5. Family have their place in this journey, but don’t rely on them for anything other than support.  6. Make sure you know who your target market is. Make it specific.  7. Sell a service rather than a product. The upside and pitfalls are much better for a service offering.  8. A CEO is the answer to all questions. The solver of all problems. The head of all departments. Be the expert.  9. Prepare for the first years of the business to be selfish and time-consuming. Find balance where you can.  10. Doing the easy things is not actually easy. You need to work at it every day.  11. Concentrate on the small wins. Eventually the big wins take care of themselves.  12. Fight for every deal, no matter how lost it seems.  13. Setting up a company to make a difference will be the best option in the short and long term. Don’t just do it for the money.  14. If you own the company, you’re accountable for everything. Embrace this mindset.  15. Work ethic and talent are the two drivers of hiring success. Make sure you recruit well.  16. Failure can be acceptable. Excuses are not. Make sure you identify both.  17. When you finish a year, make time for an honest review to reflect. This is the perfect time to make changes.  18. Assess your success at all possible opportunities and listen to external feedback from clients at all times.  19. You are what your record says at the end of the day, regardless of how hard you try.  20. Build a business for the future as well as the present. Make long-term relationships that can benefit the company in future years.","Dec 19, 2023 · 8:16 PM UTC",45,2

So I asked it the following:  ""Suggest some profitable low cost online business ideas (with a focus on content sites and blogs, software, Apss, eCommerce, email newsletters, social media, affiliate marketing) that have untapped opportunities based on these niche ideas...""  And I provided it with a list of the most commonly view niche report pages on the NicheNirvana website as you can see.  I didn't expect to get much useful back from it if I'm honest but it surprised me, here's what it gave me...  The Advice for Nurses idea are exactly the same ideas I would give myself - spot on ChatGPT.  The Coding Skills for Kids ideas are great I think because I hadn't thought about an interactive App but that would work really well.  Here's some of the other business ideas ChatGPT gave me...  The Adjustable Beds ideas make total sense though I had asked for low cost ideas and that's likely to be expensive, but I list some affiliate programs on the report on the NicheNirvana website so you could go down the affiliate site route.   The Air Fryers idea for an affiliate site or a recipe app makes perfect sense, check out the report on the NicheNirvana website to see the top selling products on Amazon and elsewhere.   And the Baby Health Trackers too - an app or content site would be perfect, I list many content sites on the NicheNirvana website in this niche report.   What else did it suggest?  The Brazilian Beauty one is spot on as many of the products in that niche are natural and organic though it wouldn't neccessarily be low cost but you could create an affiliate site instead (tip: Sol De Janeiro a Brazilian Beauty eCom brand is one of ShareASale's top earning affiliate programs, check out the report on the NicheNirvana website for this niche!)  Cat Training ideas are spot on too and there's some already very successful Cat Training courses and products on Clickbank that pay up to 75% commission - and I know from personal experience they convert (they are listed on the Cat Training report on the NicheNirvana website by the way)  For Cowboy Clothing that was the only real options it was likely to suggest but it wouldn't be low cost exactly as I specified but instead of an eCom play turn it into an affiliate site - you'd be surprised at how many affiliate programs there are in this niche (just check out the report on NicheNirvana website to see)  Due to Twitter limiting the number of images to 4 per thread I'll continue in the comments with the rest of the ideas, so keep reading...","Dec 18, 2023 · 9:19 PM UTC",21,3

Print on Demand is certainly lower cost than a lot of  business ideas as you can outsource the printing elsewhere if you find an audience for it, so that's not a bad idea but it's also quite a saturated area IMO.  Dropshipping likewise allows you to get started with little capital but I feel like it's soooooo saturated on Amazon these days and starting your own brand will be tough so not sure this is an amazing idea, it's kinda been done to death already IMO.  That was literally the only 2 opportunities it offered me which is kinda limited and poor tbh.  It also provided some basic and generic steps to get started which I don't think are overly useful due to their lack of detail or nuance.  Then this funny little comment at the end reminding us that success may not happen overnight and you have to continually improve.   Thanks for the reminder ChatGPT as we thought you could get rich overnight with no skills, lol!  Personally I'm giving ChatGPT a 3/10 at best for this one as I feel it gave too few ideas and none of them are really new plus I feel like POD and Dropshipping are more difficult to get into compared to content sites or other business models and quite saturated.  Those wouldn't be my top picks for 2024 booming, low cost, businesses.   So, how do you think ChatGPT did with predicting the greatest, untapped, and low cost, business ideas for 2024?","Dec 18, 2023 · 9:39 PM UTC",1,3

https://twitter.com/nellyagbogu/status/1737004148308967485#m,"DO NOT SLEEP ON THAT BIG BUSINESS IDEA IN 2024!  Sis, true life story.  During their University days, Uchenna was known as the business mogul of his department.  This guy has sold anything saleable while on campus, from term papers, handout, assignments, just guess, he has sold them all.  At one time in school, a lecturer gave them an assignment where they will use toads as their specimen for an experiment.  The whole class was in turmoil, where will they get toads for over 200 people in a department for experiment.  The grumbling was on another level, some said the lecturer was heartless, others said the lecturer was unreasonable.  But for Uchenna, he saw a business opportunity there, so he went out and contacted some villagers.  He told them he would give them N500 for each of the toads, they agreed, he went to his department and told his mates that one toad is N2500.  Uchenna made 2k from each toad for over 200 people in a department.   Do the maths…  He made this much, because he didn't sleep on the idea.  At a different time,   He noticed that the guys in his hostel were so much in need of groceries and floating berries (if you know you know).  But he felt selling garri and groundnuts was never his thing. The market was there, the need was glaring, but he kept analysing.  (Lesson; do not be emotional about a business that has a ready market)  He came back one noon from lectures, and discovered that someone had started his groceries and floating berries business.  It pained him so deep that he vowed never to sleep on any idea in his head.   When he left school, he got into the knowledge economy where he was selling courses.  One of those days, he had the idea to teach copywriting for beginners.  Today he has taught over 40 editions of that class using WhatsApp and has made over N150M teaching copywriting for beginners.   One biggest mistake many business owners make is to feel like the idea they got for their business is uniquely theirs asin “God placed it in their heart for them alone”  No!  That idea is also placed in millions of hearts!  What matters is ”WHO IS EXECUTING?”  Have you ever wondered why you and your team/friend may be talking about putting out the next big thing and bam!  You open your social media and realise that your “next big thing” idea has already been brought to life by your rival …  When you realise your ideas are not uniquely yours, you will focus on execution instead of daydreaming.  Prepare to be BIG on executing your ideas next year.  Make a commitment to yourself with these words.  I will execute my big ideas next year.  Thank You!   PS: Take a look at the woman that born me. Please don't ask why she is fair and i am dark.   #naijabrandchick","Dec 19, 2023 · 6:57 AM UTC",66,9

You might receive inquiries even after a year, as they won't get lost in the constant stream of 'recent' online content.  Offline marketing can offer great value within your budget.  Here are some ideas:  * Business Cards:  Yes, they are still relevant! Always carry a few business cards in your pocket. Give them to friends, relatives, and people you've had brief conversations with. Don't hesitate, as these cards represent your business socially. The cost is similar to a one-month subscription for 1,000 cards. Keep it simple – your business and contact information. Don't forget to include a 'Thank You' note and express your appreciation for recommendations.  * Letterheads and Envelopes:  They have a broad reach as they pass through multiple hands. People often pay attention to details at the bottom. You can send covers to potential addresses with a welcoming message on letterheads and a business card enclosed.  * Brochures: Design brochures that suit your industry, focusing on informative content. Distribute them to potential leads or inquiries. They provide a quick overview of your business and might sit on someone's desk for years. They could also serve as an alternative if their current provider falters.  * Banners:  Not suitable for everyone, but if you have spaces for small 3x2 framed flex banners, they can be effective on the road.  * Flyers and Pamphlets:  Flyers can serve the same purpose as brochures or advertise specific offers in larger quantities. Distribute thousands of prints across a large area at a low cost for guaranteed impressions. Great for festival or seasonal offers – for distribution there are lots off-the-book ideas!  * Stickers:  Useful for reports, files, and other stationery. Print stickers with basic details and use them on files and stationery items. Or bigger ones for Walls :) can be a poster for your ad.  * Newspaper:  Place ads in local weeklies to quickly attract business and remind the neighborhood of your presence. You can focus on city-wise placements depending on your target audience.  * Demo Tent:  Perfect for product marketing, especially for businesses involving tools or 'How To' demonstrations. All you need is space, a well-designed tent, and your best customer executive. Invite some friends to make it enjoyable.  * Other Potential Ad Placements:  Explore printed apparel, point-of-sale displays, signage, billing stationery, car/truck wraps, and calendars.  * Costlier Ideas:  Consider sponsoring events, teams, festivities, and community causes. Hosting small events at your place is also an option. Events planners can provide tailored ideas based on your business, although these options might involve larger investments.  Now, if you need assistance with any of the above, that's what I'm here for! I can handle everything from content creation to final printing and other related tasks. Stress-free and following the standard procedures of the designer-client agreement :)  Have a fantastic day!","Aug 26, 2023 · 8:49 AM UTC",6,0
